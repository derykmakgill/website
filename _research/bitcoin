This is a repost of the Non-Libertarian FAQ (aka “Why I Hate Your Freedom”), which I wrote about five years ago and which used to be hosted on my website. It no longer completely reflects my current views. I don’t think I’ve switched to believing anything on here is outright false, but I’ve moved on to different ways of thinking about certain areas. I’m reposting it by popular request and for historical interest only. I’ve made some very small updates, mostly listing rebuttals that came out over the past few years. I haven’t updated the statistics and everything is accurate as of several years ago. I seem to have lost the sources of my images, and I’m sorry; if I’ve used an image of yours, please let me know and I’ll cite you.

## "Way Back in the 90s"...and the Early 2000s

I am going to Romania next week. I looked in my library for things Romanian and found a striking essay by Mircea Eliade, Le mythe de l’éternel retour which I read when I was 18. Eliade, now known for his history of religions, was largely francophone like many patricians in pre-war Bucharest. The book is about the remarkable regularity in the formation of the myth of recurrence and rebirth across all cultures.

This seems part of our natural representation, hence Platonic. It extend beyond religion: literature has Nietzsche’s eternal return; science has Poincaré’s recurrence theorem and Polya’s proof for the Brownian motion in 2D. Beyond that, it is striking how periodicity invades science, in many places where we don’t see it.

A recurrence of historical states is pure Platonic randomness. “A drunk man will find his way home; a drunk bird is lost forever” (Kakutani).
