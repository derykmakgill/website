title: The Odyssey
---

The most distasteful thing about the Ancient Greeks is that they apparently regarded The Odyssey as the inferior of the two epic poems written by Homer? How now? The Odyssey is by far the better of the two and has remained near the top of my favorite books since I first read it in high school.

Or maybe I only think The Odyssey is better because I had the misfortunate of watching Brad Pitt's *Troy* before I read The Iliad and had very different expectations going into the book and felt let down by the fact that Paris was even *worse* than Orlando Bloom such that Helen didn't seem to like him much, Agamemmnon and Menalaus seem like pretty fine men, Hector is "meh," and the book ends before the city is even destroyed.

Regardless of their literary merit relative to eachother, The Odyssey is certainly more recongisable to we modern Netflix-addled goldfish and almost reads like a novel at times following a very classic (because Homer rather invented it) hero's journey arch that is just riveting and feels at once ancient and timely.

A teaser might read something like this: *Troy is ruined, as are the Greeks who ruined it. Agammemnon, murdererd by his wife and her lover! Aias, dashed against the rocks for pissing off a god. Achilles, dead, as are countless others. And Odysseus, missing in action while his wife and son try to protect their wealth and lives against the men of Itacha who have come to take Odysseuses place in his absence! Where is Odysseus? Will he return and save his family and land?*

## On Translations of The Odyssey

I'm unsure whether or not most readers are as obsessive about picking the "proper" translation as I am, but as a 
general rule I've found that while there are no proper translations, there is almost always an improper one, or at least one that makes so many annoying changes as to make the text have a different meaning.

For example, in the Richard Pevear *Notes from Underground* by Dostoevsky, he translates со злости as "out of wickedness" rather than the "out of spite" that has been far more common and in my opinon, far better in the context of the rest of the novel. The choice rather changes the meaning of the first paragraphs.

On the other hand, Garnett's stodgy victorianism sometimes meant she cut things out of her translations that you don't realise how much you missed until you read Pevear.

For my own part, I've read several different translations of The Odyssey over the years. When I was in highschool, I read the Rouse prose translation which I loved. Later on I tried the very popular Fagles translation from Penguin Classics, mostly because it was so well praised and the books came in the Penguin Deluxe paperback style. I enjoyed that too, however while Fagles definitely has something beautiful about his art—for example, some lines in his Orestia are just legendary—I could never quite get into him. I've also tried Lattimore, Fitzergald, and the new translation by Emily Wilson which received such incredible fawning by the twitterati that I couldn't help but bias myself against it from the start.

When you know even a little Ancient Greek, you start to notice things about the translations that rather annoy you. In the case of The Odyssey, this starts in the very first line with the translation of the Greek word πολῠ́τροπος.

Murray translates πολῠ́τροπος as "of many devices," which is imperfect but it at least gets the meaning across that Odysseys is a crafty, wily man.

```
Tell me, Muse, of the man of many devices(πολῠ́τροπος), driven far astray after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
```

Fagles is probably the most literal, and the "man of twists and turns" is a neat phrase. But I find this a bit too vague and it seems one of those examples in translation where being too literal actually makes you lose meaning in English.

```
Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns(πολῠ́τροπος) …
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy. 
```

Emily Wilson's is by far the worst of the three because she renders πολῠ́τροπος as "complicated," which is so vague as to render the description mostly useless because we are left guessing whether "complicated" refers to his moral character, his personality or psychology, or something else.

```
Tell me about a complicated(πολῠ́τροπος) man.
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy
```

There are other examples of problems in Wilson. 

```
 ‘Ah, gods!
 A happy day for me! My son and grandson 
 are arguing about how tough they are!’
 ```
 
"Tough" sounds okay until you realise she is translating the Ancient Greek word ἀρετή, which is just about the most important concept in Greek epic poetry and was written about by both Aristotle and Plato. Now while I agree the word doesn't have a direct translation into English, "tough" is certainly *not* it, and while Mitchell's translation is certainly readable and enjoyable if you're new to The Odyssey, it is *not* The Odyssey. 
 
There are also less important, some might even say trivial changes, that nevertheless I found annoying in Fagles and Wilson. Both for example, translate Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο as "Sun God," but in doing so they omit the fact that the Sun God had a name!

Wilson:

```
poor fools,
they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god
kept them from home.
```

Fagles:

```
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
```

Murray renders the name properly but perhaps a compromise between literalness and accuracy would have been good here and a future translator can write "Helios Hyperion, the Sun God."

Fagles calls Telemachus "Prince Telemachus" when "godlike Telemachus" (Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής) is the literal meaning. 

```
First by far to see her was Prince (θεοειδής) Telemachus,
sitting among the suitors, heart obsessed with grief. 
```

While I understand that describing someone as "godlike" hardly fits our time, we're reading epic literature that is thousands of years old an dumbing the story down into a Disney movie doesn't help readers get a sense of the world which Odysseus occupied.

And Wilson, well... she deserves her own commentary.

## On So-Called Modern Translating Practices

And now I turn to some more thoughts on Emily Wilson's translation and the broader culture of translation that exists in publishing today. The sense that you get from reading many of the very new translations of old works, and nowhere is this more true than in Classical Studies, is that the translator has some kind of axe to grind with the author, the characters of the world he is translating, and the contemporary world in which he himself lives.

Emily Wilson strikes me as the quintessential archetype for this kind of translator qua activist, and her Odyssey reflects all of that. For example, whereas in the past, translators were satisfied to translate a word as it was meant and give as close approximation to the intended feeling of a passage no matter how offensive to our own modern morals and tastes, Wilson is not. In place of words like attendant, housekeeper, herald, serving-woman, handmaid, woman, servant, nurse, maid, household hand, henchman, steward, shepherd, aide-in-arms, stableman, girl, lady, runner, swineherd, and slave, she just uses "slave" because according to her: 

>The need to acknowledge the fact and the horror of slavery, and to mark the fact that the idealized society depicted in the poem is one where slavery is shockingly taken for granted, seems to me to outweigh the need to specify, in every instance, the type of slave.

The problem is not that she is incorrect about slavery—it is horrible everywhere and always, in all shapes and forms, from the kindest master to the most sadistic monster. The problem is that *readers already know this,* and that in using the word "slave" constantly where "nurse" would have been more accurate, Wilson actually introduces a sort of moral awareness into the story that didn't exist yet. If it was common to refer to ones slaves not as slaves, but as "nurses" or "chambermaids" or "servants," that *tells* you something about the world of Odysseus and the slaves that occupied it. Painting it over with one catchall word that has exceptionally negative (rightfully so) connotations in today's world accomplishes in some ways the opposite of what Wilson intended. The dark thing about slavery in the ancient world is not that it existed and they were aware it was wrong and called it by its name, but that it was so deeply embedded in culture that more benign words were used instead. That *tells you something.* Emily Wilson does not.

Cultural commentary of this kind is valuable, but it should be left to sidenotes, footnotes and introductions. The readers should know they are slaves, while also being aware of the real terms that were used.

Unfortunately, it is hard to believe Wilson is acting in good faith because of the self-congragulatory, defmatory and lazy critiscms she has made against other translators who did not make the same choice she did.

>I’ve been surprised, since finishing my translation, to go back and look more at other translations, and realize how much translators have worked to remove or reduce slavery from The Odyssey. In many cases, there are interpretative questions about what a literary text means, and it’s debatable. In the case of the words for “slave”, they’re really not debatable; those are just mistranslations, motivated presumably by a desire to idealize Homeric society and Homeric poetry, and remove the troubling fact that it depicts a slave-owning society.

There's no evidence for this kind of motivation. Fagles, Murray, etc all use the word slave in their translations. And it is a great irony that while one of Wilson's stated goals is to draw attention to the slaves of The Odyssey, by giving them all one label she dehumanizes them further and readers are left unsure what they actually did in their day-to-day lives beyond being a "slave."

the Polyphemus episode seems to meditate uneasily on the processes of colonization

>But the Odyssey is also about other people: Penelope, the nymph Calypso, the witch Circe, the princess Nausicaa; Odysseus’s many shipmates who died before they could make it home; the countless slaves in Odysseus’s house, many of whom are never named.

## On Print Editions of The Odyssey

One annoying thing about particpating in translation wars is that it can often be difficult to find a quality bound edition of the translation you want, as specialty press shops usually only stock one translation at a time. For example, I'll gladly spend an evening or two with anyone defending the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoevsky's novels, but the market for quality-bound books apparently doesn't agree with me because I haven't found good copies of her tranlsations in hardcover, sewn bindings with acid-free paper, while her modern rivals like Richard Pevear have a great editions availalbe from Everyman's Library.

Fortunately that's not the case with The Odyssey and most popular translations have excellent editions available. 

For the Fagles translation, you can buy the [Penguin boxed paperback set](https://amzn.to/399ZQS4) that comes with The Iliad and The Aeniad as well, or you can spend $89 on the excellent copy from The Folio Society, which makes some of the best hardcovers on the market today. They'll last generations easily. Unfortunately the illustrations for the Fagles edition are terrible in my opinion, but if you can ignore them, it's a great option.

For Murray, you can pick up the [Loeb Classical Library Edition](https://amzn.to/2UQSwCr) which comes in two small green volumes. The books are printed on acid-free paper and are sewn. They also have the Ancient Greek text on the other side. Loebs are some of my favorite books, and they're just quality enough to be something you can pass on.

For Fitzgerald, the [Everyman's Library](https://amzn.to/399ZU4g) has great copies that are a step above the Loebs I think, though they don't have the Greek text.
