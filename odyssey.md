title: The Odyssey

The most distasteful thing about the Ancient Greeks is that they apparently regarded The Odyssey as the inferior of the two 
epic poems written by Homer? How now? The Odyssey is by far the better of the two.

## On Translations of The Odyssey

I'm unsure whether or not most readers are as obsessive about picking the "proper" translation as I am, but as a 
general rule I've found that while there are no proper translations, there is almost always an improper one.

πολῠ́τροπος

```
Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices(πολῠ́τροπος), who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
```

```
Tell me about a complicated(πολῠ́τροπος) man.
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy
```

```
Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns(πολῠ́τροπος) …
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy. 
```

```
poor fools,
they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god
kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,
tell the old story for our modern times.
```

```
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will—sing for our time too.
