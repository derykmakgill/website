title: The Odyssey

The most distasteful thing about the Ancient Greeks is that they apparently regarded The Odyssey as the inferior of the two 
epic poems written by Homer? How now? The Odyssey is by far the better of the two.

## On Translations of The Odyssey

I'm unsure whether or not most readers are as obsessive about picking the "proper" translation as I am, but as a 
general rule I've found that while there are no proper translations, there is almost always an improper one.

For my own part, I've read several different translations. When I was in highschool, I read the Rouse prose translation which I loved. Later on I tried the very popular Fagles translation from Penguin Classics, mostly because it was so well praised and the books came in the Penguin Deluxe paperback style. I enjoyed that too, however while Fagles definitely has something beautiful about his art—for example, some lines in his Orestia are just legendary—I could never quite get into him. I've also tried Lattimore, Fitzergald, and the new translation by Emily Wilson which received such incredible fawning by the twitterati that I couldn't help but bias myself against it from the start.

When you know even a little Ancient Greek, you start to notice things about the translations that rather annoy you. In the case of The Odyssey, this starts in the very first line with the translation of the Greek word πολῠ́τροπος.

Murray translates πολῠ́τροπος as "of many devices," which is imperfect but it at least gets the meaning across that Odysseys is a crafty, wily man.

```
Tell me, Muse, of the man of many devices(πολῠ́τροπος), driven far astray after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
```

Emily Wilson's is by far the worst of the three because she renders πολῠ́τροπος as "complicated," which is so vague as to render the description mostly useless because we are left guessing whether "complicated" refers to his moral character, his personality or psychology, or something else.

```
Tell me about a complicated(πολῠ́τροπος) man.
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy
```

Fagles is probably the most literal, and the "man of twists and turns" is a neat phrase. But again I find this a bit too vague and it seems one of those examples in translation where being too literal actually makes you lose meaning.

```
Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns(πολῠ́τροπος) …
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy. 
```

```
poor fools,
they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god
kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,
tell the old story for our modern times.
```

```
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will—sing for our time too.
