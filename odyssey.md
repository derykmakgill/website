title: The Odyssey

The most distasteful thing about the Ancient Greeks is that they apparently regarded The Odyssey as the inferior of the two 
epic poems written by Homer? How now? The Odyssey is by far the better of the two.

## On Translations of The Odyssey

I'm unsure whether or not most readers are as obsessive about picking the "proper" translation as I am, but as a 
general rule I've found that while there are no proper translations, there is almost always an improper one.

For my own part, I've read several different translations. When I was in highschool, I read the Rouse prose translation which I loved. Later on I tried the very popular Fagles translation from Penguin Classics, mostly because it was so well praised and the books came in the Penguin Deluxe paperback style. I enjoyed that too, however while Fagles definitely has something beautiful about his art—for example, some lines in his Orestia are just legendary—I could never quite get into him. I've also tried Lattimore, Fitzergald, and the new translation by Emily Wilson which received such incredible fawning by the twitterati that I couldn't help but bias myself against it from the start.

When you know even a little Ancient Greek, you start to notice things about the translations that rather annoy you. In the case of The Odyssey, this starts in the very first line with the translation of the Greek word πολῠ́τροπος.

Murray translates πολῠ́τροπος as "of many devices," which is imperfect but it at least gets the meaning across that Odysseys is a crafty, wily man.

```
Tell me, Muse, of the man of many devices(πολῠ́τροπος), driven far astray after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
```

Emily Wilson's is by far the worst of the three because she renders πολῠ́τροπος as "complicated," which is so vague as to render the description mostly useless because we are left guessing whether "complicated" refers to his moral character, his personality or psychology, or something else.

```
Tell me about a complicated(πολῠ́τροπος) man.
Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy
```

Fagles is probably the most literal, and the "man of twists and turns" is a neat phrase. But again I find this a bit too vague and it seems one of those examples in translation where being too literal actually makes you lose meaning in English.

```
Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns(πολῠ́τροπος) …
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy. 
```

There are other examples of problems in Wilson. 

```
 ‘Ah, gods!
 A happy day for me! My son and grandson 
 are arguing about how tough they are!’
 ```
 
"Tough" sounds okay until you realise she is translating the Ancient Greek word ἀρετή, which is just about the most important concept in Greek epic poetry. Now while I agree the word doesn't have a direct translation into English, "tough" is certainly *not* it, and while Mitchell's translation is certainly readable and enjoyable if you're new to The Odyssey, it is *not* The Odyssey. 
 
There are also less important, some might even say trivial changes, that nevertheless I found annoying in Fagles and Wilson. Both for example, translate Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο as "Sun God," but in doing so they omit the fact that the Sun God had a name!

Wilson:

```
poor fools,
they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god
kept them from home.
```

Fagles:

```
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return.
```

Murray renders the name properly but perhaps a compromise between literalnesss and accuracy would have been good here and a future translator can write "Helios Hyperion, the Sun God."

Now goddess, child of Zeus,
tell the old story for our modern times.

Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will—sing for our time too. 

## On So-Called Modern Translations

And now I turn to some more thoughts on Emily Mitchell's translation and the broader culture of translation that exists in publishing today.

## On Print Editions of The Odyssey

One annoying thing about particpating in translation wars is that it can often be difficult to find a quality bound edition of the translation you want, as specialty press shops usually only stock one translation at a time. For example, I'll gladly spend an evening or two with anyone defending the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoevsky's novels, but the market for quality-bound books apparently doesn't agree with me because I haven't found good copies of her tranlsations in hardcover, sewn bindings with acid-free paper, while her modern rivals like Richard Pevear have a great editions availalbe from Everyman's Library.

Fortunately that's not the case with The Odyssey and most popular translations have excellent editions available. 

For the Fagles translation, you can buy the Penguin boxed paperback set that comes with The Iliad as well, or you can spend $89 on the excellent copy from The Folio Society, which makes some of the best hardcovers on the market today. They'll last generations easily. Unfortunately the illustrations for the Fagles edition are terrible in my opinion, but if you can ignore them, it's a great option.

For Murray, you can pick up the Loeb Classical Library Edition which comes in two small green volumes. The books are printed on acid-free paper and are sewn. They also have the Ancient Greek text on the other side. Loebs are some of my favorite books, and they're just quality enough to be something you can pass on.

For Fitzgerald, the Everyman's Library has great copies that are a step above the Loebs I think, though they don't have the Greek text.
