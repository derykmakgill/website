He sat at a small metal desk, a deep warm light from his laptop illuminating his grave face 
in the otherwise totally dark room. If there had been anyone else on the bridge
of the Amber VI, they might have had the impression of a medieval monk illuminating the Holy Bible by a faint candlelight, not of a commander of a crippled colony star ship typing a last message to Earth, but Marten Waite was the only living person left on the Amber VI.

There had been thousands of lives that had departed with him from Earth nearly 250 years ago, among those his children, his wife, even his dog, who had all come with him on the chance that they could be among the first humans to colonise the stars. There had been engineers, doctors, plumbers, electricians, architectsâ€”anyone who would be necessary to create a new world for mankind. None of them were here now, and although he would be joining them soon, his only thought was for that most important task in front of him. Marten began to type:

<pre style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">
To: The People's Government of the Earth
From: Marten Waite
Date: 09/02/2239 (approximate)
Subject: We have failed...

I'm am reporting the loss of the entire crew and passengers of the 
Amber VI while we approached the 7-2521 system.

I have only been saved by the life-preserving systems we put in place 
to ensure I might send a message to Earth after catastrophic failure.

But I will be dead soon too.
</pre>

*The People's Government of the Earth,* Marten thought. Convinced that Earth would be uninhabitable in 1,000 years due to climate change, they had spent trillions of taxpayer dollars and debased their currency like never before to pay for the Amber VI project. It was the darling of the eco-facists, central-planners, academics, and journalists of his time, and the settlers and crew, which Marten had hand-selected, were heroes back on Earth.

Books had been written about their lives. Movies too. Sons and daughers had been named after the crew. Marten had received nearly every honor the People's Government of the Earth could bestow on a citizen for services to The People, including the Green Medallion, an award normally reserved for "the environment's equivelant of a Mother Theresa," or so a journalist had written at the time. He and his crew and fellow colonisers were to have been the first among many to start the human race again on a new planet untouched by industry, fossil fuels, plastics, and all the other man-made evils that the People's Government of the Earth had begun regulating out of existence except for their own special projects like Amber VI and the villas of high-ranking officials.

For his part, Marten had believed almost none of it and couldn't have cared less about the fame, but he had been happy to engineer and command the Amber VI because it was one of the few opportunities left in the world to build something in the old way, and he knew from the experience that it was he alone that saved the project from becoming another go-nowhere boondoggle. As for his real views, he had always kept his mouth shut anyways about the kind of topics that could get you thrown in jail or worse for speaking about during his 39 years on as a citizen of the People's Government of Earth. He had had bigger goals, he told himself during all his years of silence.

It was ironic then to him that now that he was so far away, he still couldn't say what he really wanted to say. If the People's Government of the Earth even existed anymore, all he could do was to let them know that they had failed. There would be no People's Colony on 7-2521. The trillions of dollars they had spent was a waste. Their heroes were gone forever, and in the end, it had all been Marten's fault.

I do not have time to tell the details of the mutiny that took place
that left hundreds dead and damaged critical onboard infastructure,
which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to repair, but I want
the record to show that it I alone am to blame.

Return is not possible, and it is essential that you know that the mutiny began 
after we discovered that 7-2521 is not in fact hospitable to human life.

We were wrong. I was wrong. We always knew that was a risk, and we all willingly took it. 
I have no regrets. Our failure will ensure future success elsewhere in the galaxy.

In accordance with Directive 185-A, I have engaged the self-destruct
sequence aboard the Amber VI. There will be no sign we were ever here.

Goodbye.
</pre>

Marten pressed "send" and closed his laptop. The room went pitch black. 

"Only one more thing to do." His voice echoed in the empty bridge to the ship's last active on-board AI. 

"I have already armed the nuke and have begun activating Directive 185-A," it replied. "Amber VI will self-destruct in 30 minutes."

*Then that's it,* he thought while sitting in the darkness. *Amber VI, the People's Colony. In 30 minutes, it's all done.*

"Well," he said to the AI. "That was not the the manifesto I'd always hoped to write, but it should be effective."

It would take the message a long time to arrive, and when it finally did, the People's Government of the Earth would memoralise him and his lost crew. *Heroes of the People.* Then they'd use his name as fuel for the Amber VII project and a new attempt at a colony off Earth where they could try out whatever utopian ecological experiments the scientists thought up. Most importantly though, they'd stay away from 7-2521 for a long time.

"Open the shields, I'd like to see one last time," he said as he stood up and walked across the dark room. Light slowly flooded the bridge of Amber VI as the shields retracted all around him. 

Memories flooded him too. He thought of the kid who read *Mutiny on the Bounty* and dreamt of marooning himself on a secret island, truly free in a way he could never be under the People's Government of the Earth. He thought of the time, years later, when he'd learned that the mutineers had died miserably on Pitcairn's Island, and the realisation that he didn't care, that their failure would not be his. He thought of his time in university, when he finally understood that freedom was not something to be discussed, or voted on, or worked on within the system, and that he would have to fight for it in his own way and at all costs.

He thought of the years of planning, learning, and building, so that when the time came, it was he and he alone who could make Amber VI possible, and he thought of the dark years where he'd had to do so much to keep his secrets from getting out.

He couldn't remember his name, but he still remembered the face of the employee of the People's Government Space Bureau that he had killed in self-defense before he exposed Marten's real goals. He remembered the dozens more government workers, journalists and activists whose reputations and careers he had ruined in various ways for threatening him. 

He thought of all the people he'd tracked down to join his project, of the lengths he had had to go to in order to ensure their silence and corporation. He thought of all the good people he'd had to leave behind on a world dying beneath the yoke of the mediocre nobodies who ran the People's Government of the Earth.

He thought of the real mutiny, if it could even be called that. That nasty congresswoman who had been decreed the "President" of the People's Colony because of her work in "green" legislation and technology, and her security, staff and cohort who had tried to remove him from command of Amber VI when they learned of his plans. He had forced all the latter into deep sleep so they could be reasoned with later. He'd had the congresswoman ejected into space.

Then he laughed the kind of laugh that only a man who is completely untouched by guilt can laugh.

Through the panoramic window, Marten saw the reward of two decades of work. 7-2521 was about the size of Earth, but it was somehow more beautiful. The first time Marten had seen it he had assumed it was just a trick of his mind from the intense excitement he felt, and perhaps it was, but every time he saw his planet he swore the colors were somehow better. It was as if someone had turned up the saturation on existence itself.

He didn't believe in God. But he thought this was the kind of place God would have made. It was Eden, but there were no flaming swords blocking his entrance and no concept of the original sin that nearly everyone back on Earth accepted whether they believed in God or not. Even better, there was no People's Government of the Earth and none of its citizens. He'd made sure of that when he chose the passengers and crew. 7-2521 was a chance for uncorrupted human potential. 

"Get the bridge landing craft ready." The rest of Amber VI was already inaccessible because Marten had instructed his crew that on the chance a damage report reached Earth, it would need to look real.

"Yes sir. Is this goodbye?" asked the AI. There was no emotion in its voice.

"Of course it's not. You're coming with me. I'll need you more than ever now as we build."

"But sir, according to Directive 185-A, onboard AI..."

"Fuck the People. Fuck their Government. They have no power here," he interupted. "You're coming with me."

Marten Waite walked to one of the terminals in the center of the room and inserted a small device.

"I'll talk to you when we land," he told the AI, as he transfered it to the device.

He took one last look at 7-2521. It would be a long time before he had this kind of view again. Perhaps he would never see it again. They were marooned, with no ability to reach space again, and there was so much more to build first anyways. He wasn't afraid though. He knew that all the people who awaited him on the surface were the kind of people who could make it happen. They were the most productive minds of their time, and their families. And for the first time in hundreds of years, they were free.

He walked to the far end of the room where a small door through which the last landing craft waited, and he wondered whether his kids would see the explosion from the beach head while he was on his way down to them.
