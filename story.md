The most popular mobile wallet (measured by installs) on Android is SPV. It
has between 500,000 and 1 million installs, whilst Coinbase has not yet
crossed the 500,000 mark. One of the most popular wallets on iOS is SPV. If
we had SPV wallets with better user interfaces on desktops, they'd be more
popular there too (perhaps MultiBit HD can recapture some lost ground).

So I would argue that they are in fact very widespread.

Likewise, they are not "notoriously terrible" at detecting chain forks.
That's a spurious idea that you and Patrick have been pushing lately, but
they detect them and follow reorgs across them according to the SPV
algorithm, which is based on most work done. This is exactly what they are
designed to do.

Subject: We have failed...

I'm reporting loss of the entire crew and passengers of the Amber VI 
while we approached the 7-2521 system.

I have only been saved by the life-preserving systems we put in place 
to ensure I might send a message to Earth after catastrophic failure.

But I will be dead soon too.

I do not have time to tell the details of the mutiny that took place
that left hundreds dead and damaged critical onboard infastructure,
which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to repair.

Return is not possible.

It is essential however that you know that the mutiny began after we discovered 
that 7-2521 is not in fact hospitable to human life.

We were wrong. We always knew that was a risk, and we all willingly took it. 
I have no regrets. Our failure will ensure future success elsewhere in the galaxy.

In accordance with Directive 185-A, I have engaged the self-destruct
sequence about the Amber VI. There will be no sign we were ever here.

Goodbye.
