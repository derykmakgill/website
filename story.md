The most popular mobile wallet (measured by installs) on Android is SPV. It
has between 500,000 and 1 million installs, whilst Coinbase has not yet
crossed the 500,000 mark. One of the most popular wallets on iOS is SPV. If
we had SPV wallets with better user interfaces on desktops, they'd be more
popular there too (perhaps MultiBit HD can recapture some lost ground).

So I would argue that they are in fact very widespread.

Likewise, they are not "notoriously terrible" at detecting chain forks.
That's a spurious idea that you and Patrick have been pushing lately, but
they detect them and follow reorgs across them according to the SPV
algorithm, which is based on most work done. This is exactly what they are
designed to do.

Subject: We have failed...

I must report the loss of the entire crew and passengers of the Amber VI 
while we neared Planet 7-2521.

I have only been spared their fate by the life-preserving systems and 
procedures we put in place to ensure a message might be sent back to 
Earth in the event of catastrophic failure.

I will be dead soon too, and time is running very short.
