He sat at a small metal desk, a deep warm light from his laptop illuminating his grave face 
in the otherwise totally dark room. If there had been anyone else on the bridge
of the Amber VI, they might have had the impression of a medieval monk illuminating the Holy Bible by a faint candlelight, not of a commander of a colony star ship typing a last message to Earth, but Marten Waite was the only living thing left on the Amber VI.

There had been thousands of lives that had departed with him from Earth nearly 100 years ago, among those his children, his wife, even his dog, who had all come with him on the chance that they could be among the first humans to colonise the stars. None of them were here now, and although he would be joining them soon, his only thought was for that most important task in front of him. Marten began to type:

```
To: People's Government of the Earth
From: Marten Waite
Date: 09/02/2239 (approximate)
Subject: We have failed...

I'm am reporting loss of the entire crew and passengers of the Amber VI 
while we approached the 7-2521 system.

I have only been saved by the life-preserving systems we put in place 
to ensure I might send a message to Earth after catastrophic failure.

But I will be dead soon too.
```

He paused for a moment, but not for want of words. He knew what he had to write



The most popular mobile wallet (measured by installs) on Android is SPV. It
has between 500,000 and 1 million installs, whilst Coinbase has not yet
crossed the 500,000 mark. One of the most popular wallets on iOS is SPV. If
we had SPV wallets with better user interfaces on desktops, they'd be more
popular there too (perhaps MultiBit HD can recapture some lost ground).

So I would argue that they are in fact very widespread.

Likewise, they are not "notoriously terrible" at detecting chain forks.
That's a spurious idea that you and Patrick have been pushing lately, but
they detect them and follow reorgs across them according to the SPV
algorithm, which is based on most work done. This is exactly what they are
designed to do.

I do not have time to tell the details of the mutiny that took place
that left hundreds dead and damaged critical onboard infastructure,
which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to repair.

Return is not possible.

It is essential however that you know that the mutiny began after we discovered 
that 7-2521 is not in fact hospitable to human life.

We were wrong. We always knew that was a risk, and we all willingly took it. 
I have no regrets. Our failure will ensure future success elsewhere in the galaxy.

In accordance with Directive 185-A, I have engaged the self-destruct
sequence aboard the Amber VI. There will be no sign we were ever here.

Goodbye.
