He sat at a small metal desk, a deep warm light from his laptop illuminating his grave face 
in the otherwise totally dark room. If there had been anyone else on the bridge
of the Amber VI, they might have had the impression of a medieval monk illuminating the Holy Bible by a faint candlelight, not of a commander of a colony star ship typing a last message to Earth, but Marten Waite was the only living thing left on the Amber VI.

There had been thousands of lives that had departed with him from Earth nearly 250 years ago, among those his children, his wife, even his dog, who had all come with him on the chance that they could be among the first humans to colonise the stars. None of them were here now, and although he would be joining them soon, his only thought was for that most important task in front of him. Marten began to type:

```
To: People's Government of the Earth
From: Marten Waite
Date: 09/02/2239 (approximate)
Subject: We have failed...

I'm am reporting loss of the entire crew and passengers of the Amber VI 
while we approached the 7-2521 system.

I have only been saved by the life-preserving systems we put in place 
to ensure I might send a message to Earth after catastrophic failure.

But I will be dead soon too.
```

*The People's Government of the Earth,* Marten thought. Convinced that Earth would be uninhabitable in 1,000 years due to climate change, they had spent trillions of taxpayer dollars and debased their currency like never before to pay for the Amber VI project. It was the darling of the eco-facists, central-planners, academics, and journalists of his time, and the settlers and crew, which Marten had hand-selected, were lauded as heroes.

Books had been written about their lives. Movies too. Sons and daughers had been named after the crew. Marten had received nearly every honor the People's Government of the Earth could bestow on a citizen for services to The People. He and his crew and fellow colonisers were to be the first among many to start the human race again on a new planet untouched by industry, fossil fuels, plastics, and all the other man-made evils that the People's Government of the Earth had begun regulating out of existence except for their own special projects like Amber VI.

For his part, Marten had believed almost none of it, but he had been happy to engineer and command the Amber VI, and he knew from the experience that it was he alone that saved the project from becoming another go-nowhere boondoggle. As for his real views, he had always kept his mouth shut anyways about the kind of topics that could get you thrown in jail or worse for speaking about during his 39 years on as a citizen of the People's Government of Earth. He had had bigger goals, he told himself during all his years of silence.

It was ironic then to him that now that he was so far away, he still couldn't say what he really wanted to say. If the People's Government of the Earth still existed, all he could do was to let them know that they had failed. There would be no People's Colony on 7-2521. The trillions of dollars they had spent was a waste. Their heroes were gone, and in the end, it had all been Marten's fault.

```
I do not have time to tell the details of the mutiny that took place
that left hundreds dead and damaged critical onboard infastructure,
which, despite our best efforts, we were unable to repair, but I want
the record to show that it I alone am to blame.

Return is not possible, and it is essential that you know that the mutiny began after we discovered 
that 7-2521 is not in fact hospitable to human life.

We were wrong. I was wrong. We always knew that was a risk, and we all willingly took it. 
I have no regrets. Our failure will ensure future success elsewhere in the galaxy.

In accordance with Directive 185-A, I have engaged the self-destruct
sequence aboard the Amber VI. There will be no sign we were ever here.

Goodbye.

Marten pressed "send" and closed his laptop. The room was momentarily pitch black. Not the manifesto I'd always hoped to write, he thought, but 
it would be effective. The People's Government of the Earth would memoralise him and his lost crew, and they'd use his name as fuel for the Amber VII project and a new attempt at a colony off Earth where they could try out whatever utopian ecological experiments the scientists thought up. Most importantly though, they'd stay away from 7-2521 for a long time.

"Open the shields, I'd like to see," he spoke to the ship's last active on-board semi AI as he stood up and walked to across the dark room. "And play..." Light slowly flooded the bridge of Amber VI as the shields retracted all around him. Through the window, Marten saw
