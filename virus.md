THE YEAR WAS 2035, and everybody was finally immune to The Virus. 

Many things still weren't right. Viruses killed plenty of people every year. Cataracts, depression, and all manner of physical and mental health ailments were on the rise in staggering numbers. And a vague sense of unwellness was reported amongst most of the population. 

David and Leah Carlson were watching Netflix in their living room six feet apart when their show was interrupted 
for a special White House broadcast about the The Virus.

On the television screen was the President of the United States, but you might not have known it from looking at him. Dr. Fauctus—President Fauctus—still wore the same white doctor's coat he had worn 7 years ago when he was the head of the Special Virus Task Force before he was elected president in a landslide. He had promised a government that *listens to science,* and his pollsters had told him that the lab coat went a very long way in conveying that he had delivered on that promise.
