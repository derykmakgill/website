## Introduction

Over the past few many years, I believe an effort, coordinated or spontaneous, has gone into rewriting both the history of Bitcoin and changing the design of Bitcoin such that it no longer resembles what it was meant to be when Satoshi Nakamoto announced it in October 2008. 

While a great many articles and videos exist that make good arguments about particulars, never has a general and comprehensive timeline existed that tells the entirety of this story.

## FAQ (maxis read this first)

### bcash is dead. Bitcoin moon. You lose. Why are you writing this?

I'll be the first person to admit in 2020 that the big-block Bitcoin fork experiment may be dead. Drama, network splits, bad decisions, and failure to grow quickly enough have made me less bullish on the success of Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV than ever. But the failure of these experiments does not mean that Bitcoin itself shouldn't have continued along its intended scaling path, it only means that bootstrapping a minority chain may be impossible. Regardless, it is not my intention to prove that Bitcoin should not have changed to become something different than what Satoshi Nakamoto intended. It is only to document the history of how it changed, and to demonstrate that it was not technical or economic arguments that captured Bitcoin, but a social attack of lies, propaganda, threats, censorship, state action, and more.

### Are you a shitcoiner?

No, I believe only one coin can "win" and that the coin that wins will almost certainly be some version Bitcoin with the same database going back to the genesis block. I would not be surprised if BTC is that coin. I would however, be disappointed unless I saw serious improvements over the next few decades. Bitcoin promised to be a lot more than what BTC has thus far delivered. This document, essay, timeline—whatever you want to call it—will show that.

### Who the hell even are you?

Armchair researcher. I have no special qualifications whatsoever other than that I read a lot more than most people and have, not to flatter myself too much, a *very* good memory. But all more sources are cited and you can judge them for yourself. 

## Methods and Disclaimers

### Not for goldfish.

This is not a short narrative or listicle. It's a *very* long data-dump covering over a decade of history. It is organised chronologically and can be read straight through or by jumping around to dates that interest you. There is a *lot* of material here which has never before appeared together, and if I suspect the main criticism of this paper will be that I was rather not selective enough. If you want shorter essays, I can recommend Sam Patterson's [analysis of Satoshi's writings,](https://sampatt.com/blog/2019/06/06/breakdown-of-all-satoshi-writings-proves-bitcoin-not-built-primarily-as-store-of-value) John Blocke's fantastic essay on the [censorship of r/bitcoin](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and Daniel Morgan's excellent [scaling debate timeline](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada). If you're new to the history of Bitcoin, those are also good places to start before wade through this.

### No narrative claims.

I'm deliberately leaving out editorializing about grand conspiracies to co-opt Bitcoin. I have my own thoughts on that but in my own experience, starting with those claims tends to make people ignore the well-documented facts that show, whether the effort was intentional, coordinated, or not, it was corrupt, coercive, and effective. Instead I invite readers to form their own conclusions from the timeline of evidence and I hope people may see patterns that I did not. All of that said, I won't leave out information just because it lends itself to a particular theory. If I believe it is true, I have included it.

### Always incomplete.

I may add new material to this document in the future or edit existing material. If the edits are trivial—spelling, dates, typos, etc, I won't make a note of them. If the edits are because a piece of information I included as true was fundamentally wrong, I will do a strikethrough and add a linked footnote with a correction.

### Goals.

I hope writers, filmmakes, researchers and other creators will be able to make use of the information here in their own projects. I have no delusions that this paper itself will be a giant hit—it is much too long for that—but the material here could fuel documentaries, books, essays, art, research and a lot more.

### Future plans. 

It's possible that this paper will benefit from some kind of dynamic tagging and display function that can allow readers to display only the material they want to read topically, however I think a complete chronology will always be the best way to get a full grasp of this history for those who are willing to put in the work.

### Corrections policy

I may edit this document with new material or make minor edits (dates, spelling errors, small factual details) without notice in the paper. Major changes that substantially alter the meaning or significance of a data point will be marked and noted.

## 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>I do not mean by including the early cyphepunk discussions in this timeline to suggest that the cypherpunks were necessarily some kind of ancestors or "founding fathers" of Bitcoin. To the contrary, I think the evidence shows that Satoshi was likely not deeply involved with the cypherpunks and was largely unfamiliar with their literature and thinking. I'm sharing them for two reasons: 1) because there is a common myth that the cypherpunks did not care about transaction fees in e-cash. As evidenced by this email and others, that is false. The cypherpunks were of mixed opinions on this issue, and 2) because although I do not believe the evidence shows the cypherpunks were ancestors of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto, the myth that they were and the false ideas about some of them has been very influential in shaping the development coure of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto left the project. It's important to understand the origins of these myths as well as their innaccuracies.<span class="fnHide">)</span></span> 

```
While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman. 
He has demonstrated this in numerous ways. The latest being "Cash" where 
the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time. No one is going to use digicash 
under these kinds of terms and conditions.
```

The discussion is one of the incredible coincidences in the history of electronic the first person to respond to Satoshi Nakamoto's announcement on the Cryptography Mailing List.

---

## 30 October 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May says [Digicash can never work with high fees](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>James A. Donald is incidentally, a pedophile per his blog at blog.jim.com <span class="fnHide">)</span></span> 

```
I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.
```

---

## 31 October 1995

Michael Shields [comments on the Cypherpunk List](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/37c0d0347831fe7bb5ade48e4c8e8fa93511635776c015d379f1c41c923bb2d4/) comments that the fees for Digicash will add up at every economic transaction, making it impossible to be digital cash used for everything.

```
We think of eventually using digicash for everything.  You wouldn't just
use it to pay Sears for a sweater, but Sears would use it to pay for the
wool and for their taxes.  A 5% hit may be ok for the final transaction,
but it's impossible if you incur it every time money is exchanged.
```

## 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

```
Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.

Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.
```

## 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

```
What we want is fully anonymous, ultra low transaction cost, transferable 
units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete 
dinasaurs they deserve to become.
```

Since Adam Back would later write that no early person in electronic cash cared about low fees, this is an interesting historical nugget to the contrary.

---

## ~ November 1997

Wei Dai published his [b-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) paper that would later be cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

---

## May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

---

## ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

---


## 01 August 2002

Adam Back releases the [Hash Cash paper](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf) which would later be cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. Insofar as the single reference in the whitepaper gave Adam Back enormous influence over the development direction of Bitcoin in the future, this is a very important moment.

---

## 25 December 2005

Nick Szabo publishes his [Bit gold paper.](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html) <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>An interesting piece of evidence that people have cited in support of the claim that Nick Szabo is Satoshi is the fact that the paper was re-dated to December 2008 on his blog, as if he were trying to hide the fact that he first published the paper 2005 before the release of Bitcoin. This, I think, can be easily debunked, as Nick re-dated many of his posts in 2008 as <a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/08/reruns.html" target="_blank">"reruns."</a> Regardless, the possibility of Szabo being Satoshi has very strong meme power. For example, in justifying his opposition to the 2mb blocksize increase in 2017, Litecoin creator <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/928132580469227520" target="_blank">Charlie Lee</a> said that Szabo was the closest thing to Satoshi, if not Satoshi himself, and because he opposes it Charlie will oppose it too.  <span class="fnHide">)</span></span>

## 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia,](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/) many of the same tactics he would later use in Bitcoin.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

## 16 April 2008

Early Bitcoin code generated by Satoshi prior to the release of Bitcoin shows [scraps of code for an online poker game,](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/uibase.cpp) suggesting Satoshi intended from the start that Bitcoin would be useable for small online payments.

---

## 22 August 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto [emails Wei Dai](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto) to ask him about adding his paper b-money to what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. The draft is titled: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.

```
I was very interested to read your b-money page.  I'm getting ready to
release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system.
Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your
site.
```

This is the first email we have from Satoshi and it is terribly important because it discredits the idea that Satoshi took his ideas from other well-known cypherpunks. Instead it appears that Satoshi had already developed Bitcoin and credited them after the fact.

---

## 31 October 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin whitepaper on the Cryptography Mailing List.

---

## 02 November 2008

The Bitcoin 'Scaling Wars' arguably begin with the first reply to Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper release by James A. Donald. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>James A. Donald is incidentally, a pedophile per his blog at blog.jim.com <span class="fnHide">)</span></span>

<pre>
We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your
proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>James A. Donald is incidentally, a pedophile per his blog at blog.jim.com <span class="fnHide">)</span></span>
</pre>

## 03 November 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto argues that Bitcoin can scale easily on-chain through the use of specialised data centers and Simplified Payment Verification. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>For example, on this page, I used the basic class "footnote" for the footnote span and the basic id "Footnotes" of the Footnotes div for the first group of footnotes, and I used the class "footnoteCode" for the footnote span and the id "FootnotesCode" for the Footnotes div for the bottom group of footnotes, and I used the class "footnoteSide" for the footnote span and the id "FootnotesSide" for the Footnotes div for the Side Box group of footnotes. Note that this means that in the code snippets shown above the suffixes will need to be added manually.<br><br><span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:2em;">
And this longer section of text. Though having said that in theory only inline elements should be used within the footnote content, in practice, if you include block level elements inside inline tags it doesn’t produce invalid HTML, and it seems to display correctly in all browsers.</span><br><br>This is an important moment in Bitcoin history because comparisons between Bitcoin and Bit Gold are used as evidence to suggest that Bitcoin was always intended to scale with a second layer, like Szabo's Bit Gold. However, the evidence suggests Satoshi did not even know of Bit Gold when he developed Bitcoin.<span class="fnHide">)</span></span>

```
Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double 
spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB 
per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. 
At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a 
certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms 
of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the 
network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.
```

## 07 November 2008

Hal Finney [tells Satoshi Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/threads/1/#014827) about Nick Szabo's Bit Gold idea (apparently) for the first time. This is an important moment in Bitcoin history because comparisons between Bitcoin and Bit Gold are used as evidence to suggest that Bitcoin was always intended to scale with a second layer, like Szabo's Bit Gold. However, the evidence suggests Satoshi did not even know of Bit Gold when he developed Bitcoin.

Hal also tells Satoshi that Bitcoin could be a heavyweight open system that forms the basis for a lightweight anonymous payment system (second layer) on top.

```
There havealso been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment 
schemes on top of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems so Bitcoin could be leveraged
to allow for anonymity even beyond the mechanisms discussed in the paper.
```

---

## 13 January 2009

Satoshi writes in an email to Dustin Trammel that it was Hal Finney who pointed out to him that Bitcoin could be a "long-odds" investment. Although its hard to be sure, the email hints at the possibility that Satoshi was not thinking of Bitcoin as a 'store of value' when he first developed it. He also lays out his vision for bootstrapping Bitcoin as a tool for micropayments in the range of a few cents.

```
Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a
long-odds investment.  I would be surprised if 10 years from now
we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know
a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the TTP
gets cold feet.

Even if it doesn't take off straight away, it's now available for
use by the next guy who comes up with a plan that needs some kind
of token or electronic currency.  It could get started in a closed
system or narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens,
currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites.  Once it
gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could
effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping
coins in a vending machine. 
```

---

## 12 April 2009

Satoshi [answers Mike Hearn's question](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) about scaling Bitcoin to Visa levels. He says that Bitcoin can already scale to Visa levels on existing hardware and that scaling should never hit a ceiling. He also details a fee market that would emerge with individual node operators reacting to market pricing forces.

```
>If I understand correctly, there is only one (or maybe a few) global
>chain[s] into which all transactions are hashed. If there is only one
>chain recording "the story of the economy" so to speak, how does this
>scale? In an imaginary planet-wide deployment there would be millions
>of even billions of transactions per hour being hashed into the chain.
>I realize that each PoW can wrap many transactions in one block,
>nonetheless, that's a large amount of data to hash

The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases 
per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing 
hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're 
interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 
100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think 
computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too 
burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions 
that include a transaction fee.  The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee 
they'll accept.  Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, 
but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a 
fee, or slower if they don't.  The fee the market would settle on should be minimal.  
If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with 
lower fees.  It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as 
many paying transactions as it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in 
charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.
```

---

## 13 April 2009

Satoshi [emails Mike Hearn](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) and explains that 0-confirmation transactions are should still be much safer than credit cards and that businesses will be willing to accept some extra risk for speed and ease.

```
For micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  
The size of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it. 
Micropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where 
there's no physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal 
a micropayment would probably not be a paying customer anyway, and 
if they want to steal intellectual property they can use the file 
sharing networks.

Currently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  
I believe the risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much 
less than the rate of chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.
```

## 14 February 2010

Satoshi deletes what appears to be unfinished rudimtentary code for a p2p marketplace in a commit labeled ["strip out unfinished product, review and market stuff."](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cc4b78d59f566ff43881f57797a16ce45eb1b80ez) Though the code was never finished, it suggests Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be used in commerce early on.

Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn [commented](http://eigenjoy.com/2014/05/17/bitcoin-2014-amsterdam-day-two-notes/) on this years later.

>When Satoshi launched bitcoin he was working on a p2p marketplace and you would be able to rate buyers and sellers and the weight would be according to how much mining they had done. He realized there were more important priorities.

## 14 July 2010

A <code>max_block_size</code> [value of 1MB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2614) set on the client.

## 22 July 2010

The Bitcoin.org website on [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094110/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/) lists the main advantages of Bitcoin on the homepage. In bold, it says:

> Bitcoin transactions are practically free, whereas credit cards and online payment systems typically cost 1-5% per transaction plus various other merchant fees up to hundreds of dollars.

---

## 19 September 2010

After some discussion, Hal Finney, Satoshi (Bitcoin’s creator), and the user ‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallingerr, on Bitcointalk imposed a [1MB default block size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522) to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks. [Cryddit below explains why this limit was put in place:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435)

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees.

## 03 October 2010

[theymos writes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg15143#msg15143) that the blocksize will be increased in the future and people will run only light software.

## 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

---

## 29 December 2010

Satoshi responds to Mike Hearn's question about competing with Visa and [explains](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread3.html) that the blocksize limit can be increased in time and describes a future in which pooled minesr and server farms run network nodes and users run client-only software. He also says that Bitcoin can scale with Moore's Law.

```
>The final number I'm interested in is the 500kb limit on block sizes.
>According to Wikipedia, Visa alone processed 62 billion transactions

?fundamental?

A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit 
and make sure it's working OK.

Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't 
matter much.  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire 
block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.

With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would 
be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.  
With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.

Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at 
the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.
```

## 30 December 2010

[Hal Finney writes on the Bitcoin forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211) that the future of Bitcoin will be Bitcoin-backed banks that issue their own digital cash and that private Bitcoin transactions will be very rare.

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

## 17 December 2011

Theymos writes in an [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-December/000910.html) that he believes Bitcoin should scale with lightweight clients.

```
My preferred solution for handling scalability in the future is to
have lightweight clients download only headers and Merkle trees (which
are both small and easy to distribute), and then require senders to
contact recipients directly in order to transmit their transactions.
Then lightweight clients never need full blocks to build their
balances, and full nodes don't have to handle expensive queries from
lightweight clients.
```

## 18 December 2011

Theymos writes in an [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-December/000924.html) that most people will not be able to run full nodes in the future unless they limit the blocksize, which would lead to "uncompetitive" transaction fee rates.

```
For everyone to keep being a full node, hardware costs would need to
constantly go down enough for all nodes to be able to handle enough
transactions to meet demand. If hardware doesn't become cheap enough
quickly enough, either some people would be unable to handle being full
nodes, or the max block size wouldn't rise enough to meet demand and
transaction fees would become noncompetitive.

## 15 June 2012

Mike Hearn [sends an email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001533.html) to the Bitcoin-development list stating that he is against proposals to de-rank transactions
using the same address and that addressing artifical limits and scalability is a better way to handle growing businesses like SatoshiDice.

```
There was discussion of some one-off changes to address the current
situation, namely de-ranking transactions that re-use addresses. Gavin
and myself were not keen on this idea, primarily because it just
avoids the real problem and Bitcoin already has a good way to
prioritize transactions via the fees mechanism itself. The real issue
is that SatoshiDice does indeed pay fees and generates a lot of
transactions, pushing more traditional traffic out due to artificial
throttles.

...

(3) Scalability improvements seem like a no brainer to everyone, it's
just a case of how complicated they are.

(4) Making the block size limit float is better than picking a new
arbitrary threshold.

On the forums Matt stated that block chain pruning was a no-go because
"it makes bitcoin more centralized". I think we've thrashed this one
out sufficiently well by now that there should be a united opinion on
it....
```

Matt Corallo [responds](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001536.html) in favor of punishing businesses that re-use addresses at the protocol level.

```
If, for whatever reason, someone designing a bitcoin site decides 
that it is simply easier to make users pay to a single address 
for everything, such actions should generally be discouraged.
```

Stefan Thomas [replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001551.html) to Mike's thread with one of the earliest economic arguments for removing the blocksize limit, adderssing concerrns about fees, orphans, etc.


```
What does this mean? The miner generating a 1 TB block knows this would
happen. So in terms of economic self interest he will generate the
largest possible block that he is still confident that other miners will
accept and process. A miner who receives a block will also consider
whether to build on it based on whether they think other miners will be
able to download it. In other words, if I receive a large block I may
decide not to mine on it, because I believe that the majority of mining
power will not mine on it - because it is either too large for them to
download or because their rules against large blocks reject it.

It's important to understand that in practice economic actors tend to
plan ahead. In other words, if there is no block size limit that doesn't
mean that there will be constant forks and total chaos. Rather, no miner
will ever want to have a block rejected due to size, there is plenty of
incentive to be conservative with your limits. Even if there are forks,
this simply means that miners have decided that they can make more money
by including more transactions at the cost of the occasional dud.

Therefore, from an economic perspective, we do not need a global block
size limit of any kind. As "guardians of the network" the only thing we
need to do is to let miners figure out what they wanna do.

HOWEVER, the existing economic incentives won't manifest unless somebody
translates them into code. We have to give our users (miners & endusers)
the tools to create a genuine fee-based verification market.

On the miner side: I would make the block size limit configurable with a
relatively high default. If the default is too low few people will
bother changing it, which means that it is not worth changing (because a
majority uses the default anyway), which means even fewer people will
change it and so on.

The block size limit should also be a soft rather than a hard limit...

...

The rationale for the soft limit is to allow for gradual upward
adjustment. It needs to be risky for individual miners to raise the size
of their blocks to new heights, but ideally there won't be one solid
wall for them to run into.
```

Stefan also critisizes Matt Corallo in the same email for trying to centrally plan human action in Bitcoin at the protocol level.

```
You're forcing people into privacy best practices which you think are
good, but others may not subscribe to. For example I have absolutely
zero interest in privacy, anyone who cares that I buy Bitcoins with my
salary and spend them on paragliding is welcome to know about it.
Frankly, if I cared about privacy I wouldn't be using Bitcoin. If other
people want to use mixing services and randomize their addresses and
communicate through Tor that's fine, but the client shouldn't force me
to do those things if I don't want to by "deprioritizing" my transactions.
```

[Amir Taaki expands](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001555.html) on Stefan's points and argues it would be a huge issue to try to force users to behave a certain way with their addresses because everyone has different needs and priorities. In regards to blocksize, he writes that raising it is not a concern and that Bitcoin should become more and more specialised over time.

```
Forcing users to switch addresses per received payment to work around 
a bad fee system would be a braindead decision. You might love software 
and playing with web plugins, but not everyone does. Artists like Rap News 
can right now simply throw up an address and begin accepting donations. 
That's a hugely powerful and impactful selling point for Bitcoin.

I don't really see these problems as a concern. Stefan made an excellent 
post which touched on this, in that miners have an incentive to keep block 
sizes low so that their blocks propagate. The real problem here is not about 
block propagation but the user experience. The way I see it, Bitcoin is 
becoming more specialised over time and part of that process is abstraction. 
In the past we all used the Satoshi client for mining, merchant functions, 
validating blocks and personal uses. These are rapidly diverging, and managing 
the blockchain is not something that user clients should be doing.

Mike is right when he says the network only needs a few thousand nodes to 
function fairly. I am not worried about Bitcoin becoming corrupted because of 
it being a network "by bankers for bankers" because unlike the conventional 
finance industry, there are no artificial barriers to entry beyond the base 
cost. This network would always be competitive and strictly operate based on 
market dynamics.

Case in point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem

With strict property rights and zero (or low) transaction costs, the allocation 
of a system does not matter. The system will make efficient use of its resources. 
I don't see why a cabal would try to corrupt Bitcoin at expense to themselves 
when a new competitor can enter the market and undercut them.
```

[Greg Maxwell replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001550.html) that it is an existential risk to Bitcoin to let the blocksize float and that Satoshi Nakamoto was wrong in his node calculations. He also says that slow or costly trarnsactions would still make Bitcoin competitive.

```
By itself letting the size float has non-trivial existential risk.  A
Bitcoin with expensive transactions due to competition for space in
blocks can be front-ended with fast payment systems and still provide
the promised decentralized currency. Bitcoin with a very large
blockchain and blocks does not.  

...

Mike pointed out that  "Before he left Satoshi made a comment saying
he used to think Bitcoin would need millions of nodes if it became
really popular, but in the end he thought it could do fine with just
tens of thousands"    I'm not so sure— and I think the truth is in
between. 

...

An alternative which was autonomous and decentralized even if the
transactions were somewhat slow or costly would be excellent competition 
for everything. else, and it's something I think man kind ought to have.

## 04 December 2012

[Mike Hearn](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002069.html) argues with [Greg Maxwell](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002064.html) about SPV nodes and slow vs fast adoption. Mike's position is that not everyone needs to run a node and that Bitcoin needs to move fast or it will lose its opportunity.

```
>It sounds to me that you're insisting that you're asking people who
>oppose degrading our recommendations to commit to a costly rushed
>development timeline. I think this is a false choice.
>
>There is no set timeline for the adoption of Bitcoin— man has survived

Hardly. I don't have any particular timeline in mind. But I disagree
we have "forever". New ideas have a certain time window to take off
and become credible. If they never overcome their problems in that
time window, eventually people just give up and move on. Does anyone
take desktop Linux seriously anymore? No. "The year of desktop Linux"
is a joke. People took it seriously in 2001 but despite great progress
since, the excitement and attention has gone. There were steady
improvements over the last 10 years but nobody is creating desktop
Linux startups anymore - Bitcoin shouldn't go the same way.

It's unclear we need to have every man and his dog run a full node.
Tor is a successful P2P network where the number of users vastly
outstrips the number of nodes, and exit nodes in particular are a
scarce resource run by people who know what they're doing and commit
to it.

The Tor guys could have said "every node should be an exit if
possible", but that would have been a short term optimization at the
cost of long term stability, and anyway doesn't seem to have been
necessary so far. Even with no incentives, they were able to obtain
the resources they need.

So why should Bitcoin be different? If there are a million users
supported by 50,000 full nodes, that wouldn't sound unhealthy to me.
```

Greg Maxwell [responds](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002070.html) that we can't trust the free market to provide security for Bitcoin.

```
If we depend on the organic need for full nodes to overcome cost and
effort to run one there will always be major incentives to let someone
else do that, and the system would have its equilibrium right on the
brink of insecurity. Perhaps worse, since insecurity is most obvious
retrospectively. Security doesn't make for a good market force.
```

[Alan Reiner replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002072.html) in agreement with Mike that Bitcoin should focus on getting as many users as possible even if they don't all run full nodes, and that Greg's position sounds like he's arguing to not grow the network.

```
This discussion sounds to be veering slightly off track.  I think we should
be focusing on how we will ease the transition for new users to get on the
network and use it.  Talking about the necessity and costs of running full
nodes in the future is important, but irrelevant here:  unless we don't
want users who aren't willing to run full nodes, we need to accommodate
users who want to simply "use" the network, not necessarily "support" it.  *I'm
making an assumption here that we want new users whether they use a full
node or not*.  Greg's point looks like it's veering towards "we don't want
to grow the network unless we're going to get more full nodes out of it."
I'm of the opinion, like Mike Hearn, that the number of full nodes needed
for a healthy network is *not* O(N) in the number of users of the network.
I expect it to be something more like O(sqrt(N))... or perhaps there's
even an upper limit above which the network gets no benefit, even if all 7
billion humans were using it.  (the bottleneck would be size of blocks and
CPU processing power at that point, not a shortage of full nodes).  Would
we rather have a system that is "full-node-or-nothing" and drive away users
that won't support the network, or accommodate those users with various
gradations of participation?

I think it is very much in everyone's interest here to encourage new users
to start "using" Bitcoin, even if they don't "support" it.  As long as
there is a convenient channel for interested users to get more information
about the system, the benefits of spending the effort to run a full node,
and the features available in more-advanced clients that they might benefit
from, then I'm not personally concerned about a shortage of full nodes, and
we should carry forward with the idea of promoting SPV nodes for the
really-new users.
```

## 05 December 2012

In the same [Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002074.html) thread, Alan Reiner writes in defense of SPV that it is far more important to get people experiencing how valuable it is to send money quickly and cheaply anywhere in the world.

```
Users need to experience, as quickly and easily as possible, that they
can move money across the world, without signing up for anything or
paying any fees.  After they understand the value of the system and want
to use it, they are much more likely to become educated and willing to
support the network with full node. 
```

[Gary Rowe writes in response](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002082.html) that everyone he has introduced Bitcoin to with SPV is "wowed" by the experience, and that that experience must continue for Bitcoin to succeed.

```
Without exception, everyone that I have introduced Bitcoin (which is a lot
of people) have expected an "instant-on" experience. It has to clobber
PayPal and credit cards or people won't give it a second look, let alone a
second chance. SPV clients deliver on that expectation.

Once the user has the great initial "wow!" moment then their interest in
Bitcoin is reinforced and they tend to explore further, particularly into
the economic theory behind it. Many decide to install the full node out of
a sense of community contribution to the security of the network.

Having a hybrid mode of SPV first then full node second should be something
that a user has control over - it is their computing resources we are using
after all and Bitcoin should not be perceived as a drain.

## 31 January 2013

[Greg Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.msg1492537#msg1492537) writes on BitcoinTalk that Bitcoin cannot be secure without a block limit.

```
Without a sharp constraint on the maximum blocksize there is currently _no_ rational 
reason to believe that Bitcoin would be secure at all once the subsidy goes down.

Bitcoin is valuable because of scarcity. One of the important scarcities is the 
limited supply of coins, another is the limited supply of block-space: Limited 
blockspace creates a market for transaction fees, the fees fund the mining needed 
to make the chain robust against hostile reorganization.  I have not yet seen any 
suggestion as to how Bitcoin is long term viable without this except ones that argue 
for cartel or regulatory behavior (both of which I don't consider viable: they moot 
the decentralized purpose of Bitcoin).
```

theymos [responds to Greg Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.msg1492629#msg1492629) and tells him that Satoshi always intended to increase the blocksize limit and that Mike Hearn is correct in his claims that Satoshi anticipated most people running light software. He argues himself in favor of increasing the limit in a free-market way rather than something fixed in the code.

```
Satoshi definitely intended to increase the hard max block size. See:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0

I believe that Satoshi expected most people to use some sort of lightweight 
node, with only companies and true enthusiasts being full nodes. Mike Hearn's 
view is similar to Satoshi's view.

I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation
of the "Bitcoin currency guarantees". Satoshi said that the max block size could 
be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard 
descriptions of the Bitcoin system.

IMO Mike Hearn's plan would probably work. The market/community would find a way 
to pay for the network's security, and it would be easy enough to become a full 
node that the currency wouldn't be at risk. The max block size would not truly be 
unlimited, since miners would always need to produce blocks that the vast majority 
of full nodes and other miners would be able and willing to process in a reasonable 
amount of time.

However, enforcing a max block size is safer. It's not totally clear that an unlimited 
max block size would work. So I tend to prefer a max block size for Bitcoin. Some 
other cryptocurrency can try the other method. I'd like the limit to be set in a more 
decentralized, free-market way than a fixed constant in the code, though.

Some of John Dillon's [emails leaked in an alleged hack.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.0)

The emails prove that someone who *claimed* to be US intelligence agent was instrumental in funding the video Peter Todd made about keeping the Bitcoin blocks small. He also asks about potentially hiring Peter Todd to implement some "important" Bitcoin features. Some selections from the leak are provided below.

>Please don't make this public, but my day job involves intelligence, and I'm in a relatively high position.

>To clarify Keep Bitcoin Free! is Peter's project, not mine. I only contributed funds and offered to let him use my name publicly as a supporter.

>I see that Peter Todd recently completed his audit report, even writing a small patch for Litecoin. Could you comment a bit on how that process went? I and someone else may want to hire him directly, as opposed to the bounties I've offered before, to implement some Bitcoin features and we want to get a sense of how it all went.

Peter Todd himself wrote that John Dillon creeped him out a bit and seemed to be obsessed with him.

>I know, I'll admit he kinda creeps me out a bit sometimes... he's admitted he reads all my posts.

A user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum that a version of [bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512)

The posting showed Gentoo output blocking a transaction with a SatoshiDice address, which had been blacklisted, and complains that Luke Dashjr is responsible.

>Enabling the stupidmoralnazi aka ljr [Luke Dashjr] use flag results in errors like these:

Luke replies "no sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?”

It turned out that Luke had quietly blacklisted the known addresses of several of the highest transaction-volume businesses in Bitcoin. At the time SatoshiDice in particular [was the most popular Bitcoin gambling site in the world.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-company-acquisitions-begin-gambling-site-satoshidice-sells-for-11-5m-126315-btc)

The [relevant part of the code](https://pastebin.com/4xu8avtZ) is below:

```

In the later discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called the businesses a [“DDoS attack on the bitcoin network“.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c7)

Another user rightly points out that this is nonsense and that the patch is censoring Bitcoin and [changing how users expect it to work.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c8)

>No, it's really not a DoS attack.
>
>There isn't a single reputable journalist or non-fringe blogger who refers to the popularity of the business model of satoshi dice and the other blocked businesses as a "DoS attack"
>
>There is nothing protocol-wise which is invalid about the transactions coming from the sources which are being blacklisted by this patch...

>... this patch is actively censoring and changing the behaviors of bitcoin to no longer act the usual way as defined by the the official non-patched defaults.

He later writes that [SatoshiDice is being punished for being too popular.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c6)

>Just to want to clarify on why the censorship is happening:
>
>The (alleged) attack in question is nothing more than a popular business model which has been attractive and actively used to the point where a non-small amount of traffic was generated by the sites in question. Satoshi Dice, for instance, was widely used enough that it became a target for discrimination.
>
>Paraphrased: "Too popular, and therefore there is a risk of the bitcoin network running out of capacity because of such business plans and their subsequent usage of bitcoin as a method for conducting business operations"

Luke later posted an apology and [removed the patch.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c46)

A year later, he wrote that the [trolls were lying and he never added blacklists to anything.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2zwwpi/i_feel_like_we_need_another_darkwallet_funding/cpnfgr1/)

Gavin Andresen [publishes a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122517/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/) proposing that the 1MB limit be raised to allow for scalability.

He argues that the 1mb fix was always a temporary hack and that Satoshi always intended to raise the block size.

>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.

He also writes that the expectation of Bitcoin holders from the start has always been that Bitcoin would scale up and that meeting those expectations is the same as meeting the expectation that Bitcoin would never increase the coin limit.

>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

[Greg Maxwell writes in an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k3u97/we_are_bitcoin_sidechain_paper_authors_adam_back/clhoxvu/) about the paper that he is looking at sidechains as a way to scale Bitcoin without raising the blocksize.

Mircea Popescu [describes a plan to manipulate the market and financially harm anyone supporting Bitcoin XT.](http://btcbase.org/log/?date=07-01-2015#967332) The attack is described further in a [blog post](http://qntra.net/2015/01/the-hard-fork-missile-crisis/) by another Bitcoin Core supporter.

>As the Giga-blockchain and main-blockchain continue to grow from the fork, those actively attacking the Giga-Blockchain will create many transactions that allow their main-blockchain coins to duplicate over to the Giga-blockchain while remaining safely on the main-blockchain. The transactions that succeed can then be used to acquire more main-blockchain coins upon which the cycle repeats. Eventually the blockchain with the most financial resources behind it will continue to grow at a faster pace, while the other slowly, and eventually stops growing altogether.
>
>It will be impossible for the Giga-chain to keep 1:1 parity with the main chain from which it forks, they contain different transaction, although some may overlap. Here a user broadcasts a transaction with inputs originating on the Main-chain, and is eventually included in a block on the Giga-chain, but not on the Main-chain. The coin is essentially duplicated onto both chains.
>
>Those siding with the wrong chain who end up accepting duplicated transactions from the other chain, such as a purchase from an exchange running on the losing blockchain, will lose those coins when the dust settles. No war is without casulties, the Great Blockchain Civil War will be no different.

In response to Gavin Andresen's argument that Bitcoin's block size must be raised so more people can use it, Mircea Popescu writes in an unhinged rant that [Bitcoin is not for poor people.](http://trilema.com/2015/lets-address-some-of-the-more-common-pseudo-arguments-raised-by-the-very-stupid-people-that-like-the-gavin-scamcoin-proposal/)

>Bitcoin isn't for everybody...
>
>Should blocks ever become full, older coinbases will be prioritized over newer coinbases, and larger mining fees and transactions prioritized over smaller mining fees and smaller transactions. This means that someone who wishes to pay for very little with Bitcoin will be forced to use something else, so to speak is forced to "give his seat" to someone richer. This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, unversally, as a matter of course.

>You may not like this, but that is entirely an emotional problem of yours, which you're welcome to resolve any way you can: stop being poor, take a lot of pills, whatever...

Mike Hearn writes a popular article explaining why [letting the Bitcoin blocks get full would be devesating to adoption of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32) and trust in its future. He predits the rise of an altcoin market as businesses look for new options besides Bitcoin.

>But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.

>I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept, the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative repercussions.

Bitcoin.org introduces an official ['position on hard-forks,'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894) which meant it would not promote XT.

>Bitcoin.org will not promote software or services that will leave the previous consensus because of a contentious hard fork attempt.

The move has support from Theymos, Cobra, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke Dashjr, and others according to the Github thread.

![Position on Hard Forks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/61096/8162837/d2c9b502-134d-11e5-9a8b-27c65c0e0356.png)

Developer Mike Hearn strongly cririsizes this as a move [towards centraliziation and thought control.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112121007)

>This is very disappointing David. You want to ensure new users don't learn about Bitcoin XT. Why not just say that outright?
>
>Your position is wrong and will just reduce bitcoin.org's utility as a place to learn important information.
>
>What's more, you are inherently supporting a status quo in which a tiny number of people can veto any change to Bitcoin regardless of how widely supported it is by the rest of the community. That's not decentralisation. And it is ultimately far more dangerous to Bitcoin. If you try and shut down the only method the community has to reject the decisions of this tiny group, you're effectively dooming the project to the whims of whoever happened to be around early on in the project and ended up with commit access.
>
>However, if you really want to "pick a side" in this debate like that, then given the wording of your policy if a >1mb chain wins you will have to replace Bitcoin Core completely and not mention it anywhere, as at that point, it would be the implementation leaving the consensus by attempting to produce a contentious hard fork (the 1mb only chain). So are you sure you thought this through? Are you ready for that pull request, if one day it comes?

Will Binns writes that this move will effectively [sway public opinion towards one side of the debate.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112123722)

>Bitcoin.org should try to say as non-bias as possible in the midst of publicly debated issues. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are coming to this site every day, many of which are new users learning about Bitcoin for the first time. For existing users in the space, this website is also an incredible resource in most cases.
>
>It seems like this post would be in an effort to sway public opinion more-so than anything else. It doesn't provide a complete context nor link to a wider array of information about the underlying issues it references so the reader can form their own opinion - it comes across as forcing a biased one.

Mike Hearn comments again that the clever wording in this policy—"previous consensus—means that [almost all the major payment processors, exchanges, and wallets would need to be deleted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112124088) in order to be consistent.

>Rereading the policy, there's one more reason this policy is suicide - it says you will delist any wallet or service that announces it will operate on the other side of the "previous consensus".
>
>Currently every single wallet bar GreenAddress that we've polled has told us they support bigger blocks.
>
>Additionally, every major payment processor we've talked to has also said that.
>
>Plus the major exchanges.
>
>So to be consistent with this policy you will have to delete every wallet and all major services (except GreenAddress) from the website. This would eliminate bitcoin.org as a useful place to learn about Bitcoin products and services, which is one of the key functions of the site!

He also correctly points out that raising the block size was always Satoshi's plan.

>I understand you are concerned about the notion of a contentious hard fork. I think you're wrong about the possible consequences though. It should be clear from the block chain when the change has reached a sufficient amount of mining power and at that point there would be plenty of time for services to upgrade before the fork actually happens. Nobody should lose any money and nobody should feel disenfranchised: they can just switch to the winning chain and carry on. They can always sell their coins before or after if they really believe that the plan Satoshi had all along is so bad.

After some back and forth, Mike concludes [the policy is entirely abitrary,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112136250) that most people support raising the blocksize including some Blockstream employees, and that not doing so will harm Bitcoin.

>Ah, so your policy is entirely arbitrary then.
>
>I can as well argue that in fact this situation is not contentious at all - as I said above, all major players agree on the need for larger blocks, indeed, even some Blockstream employees do (or say they do). It's really just a tiny number of people holding up progress at this point. So if you are going to decide that my definition of contentious is wrong and yours is right, just because "it's easy to say", then why have a policy at all? Why not just admit it's your opinion?
>
>Look. I don't mean to be antagonistic. I realise you are attempting to avoid harm to Bitcoin. But remember why Gavin and I are doing this - if the fork does not happen Bitcoin will suffer. You see this as some kind of one-sided deal: if a fork happens it might be bad and hurt Bitcoin, but if it doesn't happen there's no problem!
>
>I'm the developer of the first and still most widely used SPV wallets. Aaron Voisine is the developer of the most widely used SPV wallet on iOS. Both of us have reached the same conclusion about what will happen if capacity is not raised: it will hurt Bitcoin, a lot. Many others in the community have also reached that conclusion.
>
>By backing stasis you are not backing stability, or helping preserve Bitcoin's value. You are not taking a principled stand for a better development process. You are instead joining up with those who want to drive the network off a cliff. It is not bitcoin.org's place to make such decisions. Please reconsider this policy.

Another user comments that the censorship of Bitcoin XT topics is rallying the community to push back against them.

>The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community.

>Overall the video just feels... empty. Anyone who watches it won't even get close to a true understanding of what Bitcoin is. It just presents Bitcoin as something slightly better than PayPal. I think it's better if we get a new more up to date video made.

It is notable that nobody had ever complained about the video and the impression it left newcomers with about Bitcoin for years.

Cobra creates a Github issue to discuss [relisting companies that were removed from Bitcoin.org for supporting the 2mb hard fork block size increase.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) His reasoning is that the delisting *worked* to stop the increase and that these companies are unlikely to try it again.

>After the whole S2X situation, we removed links to many of the businesses that had signed the NYA. The site doesn't mention Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay, BTC.com, etc. I think enough time has passed for us to reconsider the situation. The removal and subsequent period of not linking to them was reasonable, since these companies could have attempted another contentious hard fork shortly after S2X failed, but time has shown that they've completely failed and given up at taking over Bitcoin, and are unlikely to try again.
>
>I believe that attacks on Bitcoin through manipulating large economic actors like Coinbase are a thing of the past. 

Theymos [replies and says they should not be relisted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) unless they publicly apologize and issue a statement on why they were wrong.

>As far as I can tell, if they don't do anything like that again, it'll be because it's become too difficult now, not because they've learned from it. So I wouldn't re-add them unless they admit their mistakes and in particular acknowledge that Bitcoin is not governed, especially not by miners.'

Blockstream announces their release of the Liquid full node binaries & source code and claims that ["any user can join the #P2P #LiquidNetwork by operating a full node, in order to trustlessly use the #sidechain just like with the #Bitcoin"](https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1059886244853886987)

Former co-founder of Blockstrearm Matt Corallo tweets that [this is a lie](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1060101587584991233?s=20).

>Uhhhh, I don't really know how to describe this use of the word "trustless" except "lie". Maybe someone is trying to redefine the word?

Bitcoin.org Co-owner Cobra replies that it is ["very dangerous" for him to call out Blockstream like that.](https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1060175987277729792)

Samson Mow cheers and threatens Bitcoin Cash Association creator Paul Wasensteiner's arrest and [tags the SEC on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/excellion/status/1078051212052684800)

>You’ll see real cheering when you and your wife go to jail for using @CNBCFastMoney to pump and dump #Bcash on noobs. @SEC_Enforcement.

**The same day:** [In a comment on a post by Vlad Zamfir,](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/he-imagines-a-world-in-which-crypto-political-and-legal-processes-are-necessarily-going-to-go-fb073b80dd7e) Vitalik Buterin reiterates his belief that failure to raise the block size caused huge damages to Bitcoin:

>I continue to believe that Bitcoin’s *failure* to raise its blocksize by a significant amount in 2016–17 was a travesty and a great violation of many people’s expectations of the protocol, and one that led to more total losses due to excess txfees than the amount lost in the MtGox hack), but this is the argument that you need to be arguing against.

Former Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo blocks Samson Mow on Twitter, calling it the "best decision" he's ever made and says ["I'm honestly pretty embarrassed to have helped cofound @Blockstream."](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133040768531214338)

He strongly crisizes the [troll culture popular at the company.](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133042374320562177?s=20)

>The kind of "let's be mean just because it's fun" culture exposed by a number of 
@Blockstream folks and their management is a lot of what's wrong with (a small subset) of the Bitcoin culture.

**The same day:** Matt Corallo writes that the [worst part of Bitcoin's culture comes from some of Blockstream's employees.](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133786902430146562?s=20)

>The worst parts of Bitcoin culture reliably come from folks like @Excellion and a few of the folks he has hired at

Greg Maxwell [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lightning_Network&diff=prev&oldid=930392324) to have Bitcoin XT scrubbed from the Bitcoin Wikipedia page.

```
I feel like this subject could get adequately covered as 
part of a broader article on consensusless decenteralized 
payment systems, but considering that lightning is the only
such system with even moderately wide deployment and that 
there aren't a lot of secondary sources on the broader idea... 
that gets in the way of covering it that way.  There are a lot 
of bit-rotten obscure cryptocurrency articles that should probably 
be [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Talk:Bitcoin_XT
#Bitcoin_XT_is_long_defunct_and_the_
article_is_massively_out
_of_date,_should_this_be_deleted?)

Former Bitcoin Core YouTube personality Richard Heart claims that he and others [orchestrated a social manipulation campaign in order to put Segwit through on Bitcoin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UPLA9-ICJg&lc=UgxHNItC2Cyc8zwRMzJ4AaABAg)

>Two years ago we got Segwit. Which we lied and cheated and stealed -- and I was part of the lying and cheating and stealing -- to get Segwit, to get Lightning, which by the way had critical vulnerabilities and lost people's money.

Greg Maxwell [threatens](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f5lm9r/how_roger_ver_escaped_taxes/fhzg431?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) to report Roger Ver to the federal government.

>Surely you didn't conceal your assets... that would have been extraordinarily unwise considering how widely you have bragged about your holdings, especially considering that the IRS will pay whistleblowers up to 30% of the underpayment when the total under-paid is at least $2m. But if you did disclose your assets you should be on the list?

[Michael Saylor tweets](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1329446490117451785) that governments should handle currency while Bitcoin should only store value. Sadly, the post is very popular.

>Bitcoin should be neither a currency, nor a payment network. The principles of humility & harmony dictate that we should allow technology partners to provide for payments, & defer to governments on matters of currency.  $BTC is a purely engineered Store of Value.
