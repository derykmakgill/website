## Introduction

Over the past few many years, I believe an effort, coordinated or spontaneous, has gone into rewriting both the history of Bitcoin and changing the design of Bitcoin such that it no longer resembles what it was meant to be when Satoshi Nakamoto announced it in October 2008. 

While there are many articles and videos that make good arguments about particulars, never has a general and comprehensive timeline existed that tells the entirety of this story from the perspective of people who were actually there working on Bitcoin.

## 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>I do not mean by including the early cyphepunk discussions in this timeline to suggest that the cypherpunks were necessarily some kind of ancestors or "founding fathers" of Bitcoin. To the contrary, I think the evidence shows that Satoshi was likely not deeply involved with the cypherpunks and was largely unfamiliar with their literature and thinking. I'm sharing them for two reasons: 1) because there is a common myth that the cypherpunks did not care about transaction fees in e-cash. As evidenced by this email and others, that is false. The cypherpunks were of mixed opinions on this issue, and 2) because although I do not believe the evidence shows the cypherpunks were ancestors of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto, the myth that they were and the false ideas about some of them has been very influential in shaping the development coure of Bitcoin after Satoshi Nakamoto left the project. It's important to understand the origins of these myths as well as their innaccuracies.<span class="fnHide">)</span></span> 

```
While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman. 
He has demonstrated this in numerous ways. The latest being "Cash" where 
the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time. No one is going to use digicash 
under these kinds of terms and conditions.
```

The discussion is one of the incredible coincidences in the history of electronic the first person to respond to Satoshi Nakamoto's announcement on the Cryptography Mailing List.

---

## 30 October 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May says [Digicash can never work with high fees](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
```
I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.
```

---

## 31 October 1995

Michael Shields [comments on the Cypherpunk List](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/37c0d0347831fe7bb5ade48e4c8e8fa93511635776c015d379f1c41c923bb2d4/) comments that the fees for Digicash will add up at every economic transaction, making it impossible to be digital cash used for everything.

```
We think of eventually using digicash for everything.  You wouldn't just
use it to pay Sears for a sweater, but Sears would use it to pay for the
wool and for their taxes.  A 5% hit may be ok for the final transaction,
but it's impossible if you incur it every time money is exchanged.
```

## 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

```
Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.

Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.
```

---

## 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

```
What we want is fully anonymous, ultra low transaction cost, transferable 
units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete 
dinasaurs they deserve to become.
```

Since Adam Back would later write that no early person in electronic cash cared about low fees, this is an interesting historical nugget to the contrary.

---

## ~ November 1997

Wei Dai published his [b-money](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) paper that would later be cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

---

## May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

---

## ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

---


## 01 August 2002

Adam Back releases the [Hash Cash paper](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf) which would later be cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. Insofar as the single reference in the whitepaper gave Adam Back enormous influence over the development direction of Bitcoin in the future, this is a very important moment.

---

## 25 December 2005

Nick Szabo publishes his [Bit gold paper.](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html) <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>An interesting piece of evidence that people have cited in support of the claim that Nick Szabo is Satoshi is the fact that the paper was re-dated to December 2008 on his blog, as if he were trying to hide the fact that he first published the paper 2005 before the release of Bitcoin. This, I think, can be easily debunked, as Nick re-dated many of his posts in 2008 as <a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/08/reruns.html" target="_blank">"reruns."</a> Regardless, the possibility of Szabo being Satoshi has very strong meme power. For example, in justifying his opposition to the 2mb blocksize increase in 2017, Litecoin creator <a href="https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/928132580469227520" target="_blank">Charlie Lee</a> said that Szabo was the closest thing to Satoshi, if not Satoshi himself, and because he opposes it Charlie will oppose it too.  <span class="fnHide">)</span></span>

## 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia,](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/) many of the same tactics he would later use in Bitcoin.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

---

## 14 July 2007

[Greg Maxwell is again accused](http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2007/07/reactionary-english-wikipedia-admins.html) of aggressive and harassing behavior on WikiPedia.

> Just look at the talk page - people complained about 1) not discussing this first and for being concocted off-wiki. and 2) it slowed down the site for people seeing the message. Fair complaints? I think so. Then Gmaxwell swoops in and has a temper tantrum. No wonder it didn't go anywhere, despite being a great idea...
>
>Gregory, you are one of the most consistent jerks on the entire project (to anyone who doesn't happen to be one of your little buddies). I first noticed this a couple of years ago when you and Cyde were viciously harassing members of a particular religion. (look in Cyde's block log for a self block that denotes this episode)...
>
>Gregory, you went batshit insane spaming English voters to vote in this election, and as a response to criticism offered to help other languages once you knew it was too late.

## 16 April 2008

Early Bitcoin code generated by Satoshi prior to the release of Bitcoin shows [scraps of code for an online poker game,](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/uibase.cpp) suggesting Satoshi intended from the start that Bitcoin would be useable for small online payments. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>Though it is still largely conjecture, there is some interesting evidence that Satoshi may have even had connections or motivations from the gambling industry. The Unlawful Intenret Gambling Enforcement Act was passed not 6 months or so before Satoshi, by his own remarks, began working on Bitcoin. As is noted in this paper, Satoshi's early code contained built in poker functions, and on October 10th 2008, just weeks before Bitcoin was announced to the world, Lasseters, one of the oldest and largest online casinos, announced it would close after two years of regulatory hassle. <span class="fnHide">)</span></span> 

---

## 22 August 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto [emails Wei Dai](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto) to ask him about adding his paper b-money to what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. The draft is titled: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.

```
I was very interested to read your b-money page.  I'm getting ready to
release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system.
Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your
site.
```

This is the first email we have from Satoshi and it is terribly important because it discredits the idea that Satoshi took his ideas from other well-known cypherpunks. Instead it appears that Satoshi had already developed Bitcoin and credited them after the fact.

---

## 31 October 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto releases the Bitcoin whitepaper on the Cryptography Mailing List.

---

## 02 November 2008

The Bitcoin 'Scaling Wars' arguably begin with the first reply to Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper release by James A. Donald. 
<pre>
We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your
proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size. 
</pre>

---

## 03 November 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto argues that Bitcoin can scale easily on-chain through the use of specialised data centers and Simplified Payment Verification. 

```
Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double 
spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB 
per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. 
At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a 
certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms 
of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the 
network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.
```

---

## 07 November 2008

Hal Finney [tells Satoshi Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/threads/1/#014827) about Nick Szabo's Bit Gold idea (apparently) for the first time. This is an important moment in Bitcoin history because comparisons between Bitcoin and Bit Gold are used as evidence to suggest that Bitcoin was always intended to scale with a second layer, like Szabo's Bit Gold. However, the evidence suggests Satoshi did not even know of Bit Gold when he developed Bitcoin.

Hal also tells Satoshi that Bitcoin could be a heavyweight open system that forms the basis for a lightweight anonymous payment system (second layer) on top.

```
There havealso been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment 
schemes on top of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems so Bitcoin could be leveraged
to allow for anonymity even beyond the mechanisms discussed in the paper.
```

---

## 13 January 2009

Satoshi writes in an email to Dustin Trammel that it was Hal Finney who pointed out to him that Bitcoin could be a "long-odds" investment. <span class="footnote"><span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span>An alternative version of this email exists on the public mailing lists due to the fact that this email was forwarded by Satoshi with permission from Dustin Trammel. For whatever reason though, it does not include the comment about Hal Finney's price predictions. That comment comes from Trammel's own archive of his emails which are no longer live on his site. It's hard to make much more of it but it is perhaps worth speculating on. <span class="fnHide">)</span></span> Although its hard to be sure, the email hints at the possibility that Satoshi was not thinking of Bitcoin as a 'store of value' when he first developed it. He also lays out his vision for bootstrapping Bitcoin as a tool for micropayments in the range of a few cents.

```
Hal sort of alluded to the possibility that it could be seen as a
long-odds investment.  I would be surprised if 10 years from now
we're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know
a way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the TTP
gets cold feet.

Even if it doesn't take off straight away, it's now available for
use by the next guy who comes up with a plan that needs some kind
of token or electronic currency.  It could get started in a closed
system or narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens,
currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites.  Once it
gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could
effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping
coins in a vending machine. 
```

## 12 April 2009

Satoshi [answers Mike Hearn's question](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) about scaling Bitcoin to Visa levels. He says that Bitcoin can already scale to Visa levels on existing hardware and that scaling should never hit a ceiling. He also details a fee market that would emerge with individual node operators reacting to market pricing forces.

```
>If I understand correctly, there is only one (or maybe a few) global
>chain[s] into which all transactions are hashed. If there is only one
>chain recording "the story of the economy" so to speak, how does this
>scale? In an imaginary planet-wide deployment there would be millions
>of even billions of transactions per hour being hashed into the chain.
>I realize that each PoW can wrap many transactions in one block,
>nonetheless, that's a large amount of data to hash

The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases 
per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing 
hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're 
interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 
100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think 
computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too 
burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions 
that include a transaction fee.  The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee 
they'll accept.  Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, 
but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a 
fee, or slower if they don't.  The fee the market would settle on should be minimal.  
If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with 
lower fees.  It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as 
many paying transactions as it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in 
charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.
```

## 13 April 2009

Satoshi [emails Mike Hearn](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html) and explains that 0-confirmation transactions are should still be much safer than credit cards and that businesses will be willing to accept some extra risk for speed and ease.

```
For micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  
The size of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it. 
Micropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where 
there's no physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal 
a micropayment would probably not be a paying customer anyway, and 
if they want to steal intellectual property they can use the file 
sharing networks.

Currently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  
I believe the risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much 
less than the rate of chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.
```

## 14 February 2010

Satoshi deletes what appears to be unfinished rudimtentary code for a p2p marketplace in a commit labeled ["strip out unfinished product, review and market stuff."](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cc4b78d59f566ff43881f57797a16ce45eb1b80ez) Though the code was never finished, it suggests Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be used in commerce early on.

Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn [commented](http://eigenjoy.com/2014/05/17/bitcoin-2014-amsterdam-day-two-notes/) on this years later.

>When Satoshi launched bitcoin he was working on a p2p marketplace and you would be able to rate buyers and sellers and the weight would be according to how much mining they had done. He realized there were more important priorities.

## 08 September 2010

[Satoshi explains](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=994.msg12237#msg12237) that the limits currently exist to control spam but that they can easily change the threshold when it is necessary in the future.

```
The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide 
to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it 
lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit 
the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood 
and not actual use.  Keeping the threshold lower would help limit 
the amount of wasted disk space in that event.
```

---

## 30 September 2010

[Early Bitcoiners discuss](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg1461) competing with Visa on BitcoinTalk and scaling Bitcoin with a blocksize increase.

```
I did a quick Google search on the topic, and discovered an old Visa 
press release that stated that during the peak hour for the year of 2005 
(Dec 23rd) Visa processed an average of 6,363 transactions per second, 
or just shy of 3.82 million transactions within a ten minute span.  The 
same press release made the claim that Visa processed more transactions 
within a coffee break than all of the world's public stock exchanges have 
ever done on their best day. combined.  I'm afraid I can't link it however, 
you will have to search for it yourself.  "How many transactions?" should 
work.
```

```
That's a lot. Bitcoin won't allow blocks over 1MB, so assuming a (rather small)
average transaction size of 216 bytes, Bitcoin can only handle 4,629 transactions 
per 10 minutes.
```

```
That hard limit is going to have to be bumped up if/when Bitcoin takes off.  463
transactions per minute wouldn't be anywhere near viable for a worldwide online 
currency.  We, at least, need to be able to handle the number of average transactions 
per minute that paypal claims they currently average.
```

```
Maybe we can scale the block limit, like we scale the difficulty?
Compute average block size over past two weeks, and don't accept 
blocks over AVG_SIZE*100 ?
```

```
+1 Scaling to high transaction rate has always been my main concern about viability 
of bitcoin.  I'm much more concerned about scalability than government shutdown, 
for example.

## 01 October 2010

[theymos says](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg14795#msg14795) the blocksize can be carefully raised when necessary and points out that since blocks are never full at the time, it's not a problem.

[Jeff Garzik writes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg14911#msg14911) that at minimum Bitcoin needs to compete with PayPal level speed.

```
Otherwise, I don't see how we can convince others that bitcoin is a long 
term viable [micro]currency, if technical limitations keep bitcoin below 
500 transactions/minute.
```

---

## 03 October 2010

[theymos writes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg15143#msg15143) that the blocksize will be increased in the future and people will run only light software.

When asked where the limit comes from, Theymos [writes](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.msg15122#msg15122) that the limit is arbitrary and probably there to reduce DDos.

## 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

---

## 29 December 2010

Satoshi responds to Mike Hearn's question about competing with Visa and [explains](https://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread3.html) that the blocksize limit can be increased in time and describes a future in which pooled minesr and server farms run network nodes and users run client-only software. He also says that Bitcoin can scale with Moore's Law.

```
>The final number I'm interested in is the 500kb limit on block sizes.

?fundamental?

A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit 
and make sure it's working OK.

Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't 
matter much.  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire 
block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.

With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would 
be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.  
With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.

Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at 
the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.
```

## 30 December 2010

[Hal Finney writes on the Bitcoin forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211) that the future of Bitcoin will be Bitcoin-backed banks that issue their own digital cash and that private Bitcoin transactions will be very rare.

>Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.
>
>Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
>
>George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.
>
>I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.

One early Bitcoiner comments that the Bitcoin [forums are becoming a horrible place to discuss things](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg304289#msg304289) because of moderators censoring old threads and trolls are shouting people down.

>forum.bitcoin.org is the single worst place on the internet to talk about bitcoin. Dissenting voices are regularly shouted down or dismissed as trolls. Moderators are now deleting longstanding threads of great interest. The worst part is, in bitcoin-forumland, the internet is nothing but America.

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

## 30 July 2011

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

## 17 December 2011

Theymos writes in an [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-December/000910.html) that he believes Bitcoin should scale with lightweight clients.

```
My preferred solution for handling scalability in the future is to
have lightweight clients download only headers and Merkle trees (which
are both small and easy to distribute), and then require senders to
contact recipients directly in order to transmit their transactions.
Then lightweight clients never need full blocks to build their
balances, and full nodes don't have to handle expensive queries from
lightweight clients.
```

## 18 December 2011

Theymos writes in an [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2011-December/000924.html) that most people will not be able to run full nodes in the future unless they limit the blocksize, which would lead to "uncompetitive" transaction fee rates.

```
For everyone to keep being a full node, hardware costs would need to
constantly go down enough for all nodes to be able to handle enough
transactions to meet demand. If hardware doesn't become cheap enough
quickly enough, either some people would be unable to handle being full
nodes, or the max block size wouldn't rise enough to meet demand and
transaction fees would become noncompetitive.
```

## 15 June 2012

Mike Hearn [sends an email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001533.html) to the Bitcoin-development list stating that he is against proposals to de-rank transactions
using the same address and that addressing artifical limits and scalability is a better way to handle growing businesses like SatoshiDice.

```
There was discussion of some one-off changes to address the current
situation, namely de-ranking transactions that re-use addresses. Gavin
and myself were not keen on this idea, primarily because it just
avoids the real problem and Bitcoin already has a good way to
prioritize transactions via the fees mechanism itself. The real issue
is that SatoshiDice does indeed pay fees and generates a lot of
transactions, pushing more traditional traffic out due to artificial
throttles.

...

(3) Scalability improvements seem like a no brainer to everyone, it's
just a case of how complicated they are.

(4) Making the block size limit float is better than picking a new
arbitrary threshold.

On the forums Matt stated that block chain pruning was a no-go because
"it makes bitcoin more centralized". I think we've thrashed this one
out sufficiently well by now that there should be a united opinion on
it....
```

Matt Corallo [responds](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001536.html) in favor of punishing businesses that re-use addresses at the protocol level.

```
If, for whatever reason, someone designing a bitcoin site decides 
that it is simply easier to make users pay to a single address 
for everything, such actions should generally be discouraged.
```

Stefan Thomas [replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001551.html) to Mike's thread with one of the earliest economic arguments for removing the blocksize limit, adderssing concerrns about fees, orphans, etc.


```
What does this mean? The miner generating a 1 TB block knows this would
happen. So in terms of economic self interest he will generate the
largest possible block that he is still confident that other miners will
accept and process. A miner who receives a block will also consider
whether to build on it based on whether they think other miners will be
able to download it. In other words, if I receive a large block I may
decide not to mine on it, because I believe that the majority of mining
power will not mine on it - because it is either too large for them to
download or because their rules against large blocks reject it.

It's important to understand that in practice economic actors tend to
plan ahead. In other words, if there is no block size limit that doesn't
mean that there will be constant forks and total chaos. Rather, no miner
will ever want to have a block rejected due to size, there is plenty of
incentive to be conservative with your limits. Even if there are forks,
this simply means that miners have decided that they can make more money
by including more transactions at the cost of the occasional dud.

Therefore, from an economic perspective, we do not need a global block
size limit of any kind. As "guardians of the network" the only thing we
need to do is to let miners figure out what they wanna do.

HOWEVER, the existing economic incentives won't manifest unless somebody
translates them into code. We have to give our users (miners & endusers)
the tools to create a genuine fee-based verification market.

On the miner side: I would make the block size limit configurable with a
relatively high default. If the default is too low few people will
bother changing it, which means that it is not worth changing (because a
majority uses the default anyway), which means even fewer people will
change it and so on.

The block size limit should also be a soft rather than a hard limit...

...

The rationale for the soft limit is to allow for gradual upward
adjustment. It needs to be risky for individual miners to raise the size
of their blocks to new heights, but ideally there won't be one solid
wall for them to run into.
```

Stefan also critisizes Matt Corallo in the same email for trying to centrally plan human action in Bitcoin at the protocol level.

```
You're forcing people into privacy best practices which you think are
good, but others may not subscribe to. For example I have absolutely
zero interest in privacy, anyone who cares that I buy Bitcoins with my
salary and spend them on paragliding is welcome to know about it.
Frankly, if I cared about privacy I wouldn't be using Bitcoin. If other
people want to use mixing services and randomize their addresses and
communicate through Tor that's fine, but the client shouldn't force me
to do those things if I don't want to by "deprioritizing" my transactions.
```

[Amir Taaki expands](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001555.html) on Stefan's points and argues it would be a huge issue to try to force users to behave a certain way with their addresses because everyone has different needs and priorities. In regards to blocksize, he writes that raising it is not a concern and that Bitcoin should become more and more specialised over time.

```
Forcing users to switch addresses per received payment to work around 
a bad fee system would be a braindead decision. You might love software 
and playing with web plugins, but not everyone does. Artists like Rap News 
can right now simply throw up an address and begin accepting donations. 
That's a hugely powerful and impactful selling point for Bitcoin.

I don't really see these problems as a concern. Stefan made an excellent 
post which touched on this, in that miners have an incentive to keep block 
sizes low so that their blocks propagate. The real problem here is not about 
block propagation but the user experience. The way I see it, Bitcoin is 
becoming more specialised over time and part of that process is abstraction. 
In the past we all used the Satoshi client for mining, merchant functions, 
validating blocks and personal uses. These are rapidly diverging, and managing 
the blockchain is not something that user clients should be doing.

Mike is right when he says the network only needs a few thousand nodes to 
function fairly. I am not worried about Bitcoin becoming corrupted because of 
it being a network "by bankers for bankers" because unlike the conventional 
finance industry, there are no artificial barriers to entry beyond the base 
cost. This network would always be competitive and strictly operate based on 
market dynamics.

Case in point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem

With strict property rights and zero (or low) transaction costs, the allocation 
of a system does not matter. The system will make efficient use of its resources. 
I don't see why a cabal would try to corrupt Bitcoin at expense to themselves 
when a new competitor can enter the market and undercut them.
```

[Greg Maxwell replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-June/001550.html) that it is an existential risk to Bitcoin to let the blocksize float and that Satoshi Nakamoto was wrong in his node calculations. He also says that slow or costly trarnsactions would still make Bitcoin competitive.

```
By itself letting the size float has non-trivial existential risk.  A
Bitcoin with expensive transactions due to competition for space in
blocks can be front-ended with fast payment systems and still provide
the promised decentralized currency. Bitcoin with a very large
blockchain and blocks does not.  

...

Mike pointed out that  "Before he left Satoshi made a comment saying
he used to think Bitcoin would need millions of nodes if it became
really popular, but in the end he thought it could do fine with just
tens of thousands"    I'm not so sure— and I think the truth is in
between. 

...

An alternative which was autonomous and decentralized even if the
transactions were somewhat slow or costly would be excellent competition 
for everything. else, and it's something I think man kind ought to have.

## 04 December 2012

[Mike Hearn](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002069.html) argues with [Greg Maxwell](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002064.html) about SPV nodes and slow vs fast adoption. Mike's position is that not everyone needs to run a node and that Bitcoin needs to move fast or it will lose its opportunity.

```
>It sounds to me that you're insisting that you're asking people who

>
>There is no set timeline for the adoption of Bitcoin— man has survived

Hardly. I don't have any particular timeline in mind. But I disagree
we have "forever". New ideas have a certain time window to take off
and become credible. If they never overcome their problems in that
time window, eventually people just give up and move on. Does anyone
take desktop Linux seriously anymore? No. "The year of desktop Linux"
is a joke. People took it seriously in 2001 but despite great progress
since, the excitement and attention has gone. There were steady
improvements over the last 10 years but nobody is creating desktop
Linux startups anymore - Bitcoin shouldn't go the same way.

It's unclear we need to have every man and his dog run a full node.
Tor is a successful P2P network where the number of users vastly
outstrips the number of nodes, and exit nodes in particular are a
scarce resource run by people who know what they're doing and commit
to it.

The Tor guys could have said "every node should be an exit if
possible", but that would have been a short term optimization at the
cost of long term stability, and anyway doesn't seem to have been
necessary so far. Even with no incentives, they were able to obtain
the resources they need.

So why should Bitcoin be different? If there are a million users
supported by 50,000 full nodes, that wouldn't sound unhealthy to me.
```

Greg Maxwell [responds](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002070.html) that we can't trust the free market to provide security for Bitcoin.

```
If we depend on the organic need for full nodes to overcome cost and
effort to run one there will always be major incentives to let someone
else do that, and the system would have its equilibrium right on the
brink of insecurity. Perhaps worse, since insecurity is most obvious
retrospectively. Security doesn't make for a good market force.
```

[Alan Reiner replies](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002072.html) in agreement with Mike that Bitcoin should focus on getting as many users as possible even if they don't all run full nodes, and that Greg's position sounds like he's arguing to not grow the network.

```
This discussion sounds to be veering slightly off track.  I think we should
be focusing on how we will ease the transition for new users to get on the
network and use it.  Talking about the necessity and costs of running full
nodes in the future is important, but irrelevant here:  unless we don't
want users who aren't willing to run full nodes, we need to accommodate
users who want to simply "use" the network, not necessarily "support" it.  *I'm
making an assumption here that we want new users whether they use a full
node or not*.  Greg's point looks like it's veering towards "we don't want
to grow the network unless we're going to get more full nodes out of it."
I'm of the opinion, like Mike Hearn, that the number of full nodes needed
for a healthy network is *not* O(N) in the number of users of the network.
I expect it to be something more like O(sqrt(N))... or perhaps there's
even an upper limit above which the network gets no benefit, even if all 7
billion humans were using it.  (the bottleneck would be size of blocks and
CPU processing power at that point, not a shortage of full nodes).  Would
we rather have a system that is "full-node-or-nothing" and drive away users
that won't support the network, or accommodate those users with various
gradations of participation?

I think it is very much in everyone's interest here to encourage new users
to start "using" Bitcoin, even if they don't "support" it.  As long as
there is a convenient channel for interested users to get more information
about the system, the benefits of spending the effort to run a full node,
and the features available in more-advanced clients that they might benefit
from, then I'm not personally concerned about a shortage of full nodes, and
we should carry forward with the idea of promoting SPV nodes for the
really-new users.
```

## 05 December 2012

In the same [Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002074.html) thread, Alan Reiner writes in defense of SPV that it is far more important to get people experiencing how valuable it is to send money quickly and cheaply anywhere in the world.

```
Users need to experience, as quickly and easily as possible, that they
can move money across the world, without signing up for anything or
paying any fees.  After they understand the value of the system and want
to use it, they are much more likely to become educated and willing to
support the network with full node. 
```

[Gary Rowe writes in response](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2012-December/002082.html) that everyone he has introduced Bitcoin to with SPV is "wowed" by the experience, and that that experience must continue for Bitcoin to succeed.

```
Without exception, everyone that I have introduced Bitcoin (which is a lot
of people) have expected an "instant-on" experience. It has to clobber
PayPal and credit cards or people won't give it a second look, let alone a
second chance. SPV clients deliver on that expectation.

Once the user has the great initial "wow!" moment then their interest in
Bitcoin is reinforced and they tend to explore further, particularly into
the economic theory behind it. Many decide to install the full node out of
a sense of community contribution to the security of the network.

Having a hybrid mode of SPV first then full node second should be something
that a user has control over - it is their computing resources we are using
after all and Bitcoin should not be perceived as a drain.

## 31 January 2013

[Greg Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.msg1492537#msg1492537) writes on BitcoinTalk that Bitcoin cannot be secure without a block limit.

```
Without a sharp constraint on the maximum blocksize there is currently _no_ rational 
reason to believe that Bitcoin would be secure at all once the subsidy goes down.

Bitcoin is valuable because of scarcity. One of the important scarcities is the 
limited supply of coins, another is the limited supply of block-space: Limited 
blockspace creates a market for transaction fees, the fees fund the mining needed 
to make the chain robust against hostile reorganization.  I have not yet seen any 
suggestion as to how Bitcoin is long term viable without this except ones that argue 
for cartel or regulatory behavior (both of which I don't consider viable: they moot 
the decentralized purpose of Bitcoin).
```

theymos [responds to Greg Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.msg1492629#msg1492629) and tells him that Satoshi always intended to increase the blocksize limit and that Mike Hearn is correct in his claims that Satoshi anticipated most people running light software. He argues himself in favor of increasing the limit in a free-market way rather than something fixed in the code.

```
Satoshi definitely intended to increase the hard max block size. See:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0

I believe that Satoshi expected most people to use some sort of lightweight 
node, with only companies and true enthusiasts being full nodes. Mike Hearn's 
view is similar to Satoshi's view.

I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation
of the "Bitcoin currency guarantees". Satoshi said that the max block size could 
be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard 
descriptions of the Bitcoin system.

IMO Mike Hearn's plan would probably work. The market/community would find a way 
to pay for the network's security, and it would be easy enough to become a full 
node that the currency wouldn't be at risk. The max block size would not truly be 
unlimited, since miners would always need to produce blocks that the vast majority 
of full nodes and other miners would be able and willing to process in a reasonable 
amount of time.

However, enforcing a max block size is safer. It's not totally clear that an unlimited 
max block size would work. So I tend to prefer a max block size for Bitcoin. Some 
other cryptocurrency can try the other method. I'd like the limit to be set in a more 
decentralized, free-market way than a fixed constant in the code, though.

I really don't understand this either/or mentality.

OF COURSE we're going to raise the block size limit. Limiting the main
blockchain to single-digit transactions-per-second is not an option,
the vision FOREVER has been to scale it up.

And OF COURSE there will be off-chain transactions-- at the very
least, we need them for "instantly confirmed" transactions.

## 09 April 2013

[Mike Hearn](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002378.html) writes in a discussion about data 'spam' that trying to define what an abusive transaction is can end up excludin many valuable ones.

```
It's tempting to see this kind of abuse through the lens of fees, because
we only have a few hammers and so everything looks like a kind of nail. The
problem is the moment you try to define "abuse" economically you end up
excluding legitimate and beneficial uses as well. Maybe Peters patch for
uneconomical outputs is different because of how it works. But mostly it's
true. In this case, fees would never work - Peter said the guy who uploaded
Wikileaks paid something like $500 to do it. I guess by now it's more like
$600-$700. It's hard for regular end users to compete with that kind of
wild-eyed dedication to "the cause".

The root problem here is people believe the block chain is a data structure
that will live forever and be served by everyone for free, in perpetuity,
and is thus the perfect place for "uncensorable" stuff. That's a reasonable
assumption given how Bitcoin works today. But there's no reason it will be
true in the long run (I know this can be an unpopular viewpoint).

I think it's worth pointing out that Bitcoin was launched with no DoS
protection at all, and it's still here. There are still obvious DoS bugs
being fixed with every release. So yes, it's important to robustify the
code, but not to the extent of not having any features. If Satoshi had
taken that perspective Bitcoin might not exist at all. We can have our cake

In the ongoing discussion about the Peter Todd video, a forum member [points out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2293256#msg2293256) that Peter Todd's limited blocks + high fees solution will lead to proprietary payment networks, a sort of PayPal 2.0 rather than what Bitcoin was intended to be.

>This is just my opinion, but I think the vast majority of people would prefer a fully automated p2p network that's made up of thousands of nodes operated by enterprises, than a fully automated p2p network with hundreds of thousands of nodes operated by hobbyists, but with the disadvantage that you need to trust third party payment processors for any kind of real world use of currency.

[Peter Todd](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-May/002683.html) sends an email to complain that miners are growing too big and powerful, and says breaking them up will help prevent blocksize increases in the future.

```
Right now between two to four running the largest pools control Bitcoin
in the short term. That's a lot of hashing power in the hands of very,
very few people...

This needs to change...

Finally, for the record, a big part of the reason why myself and other
Keep Bitcoin Free supporters are interested in doing this is very much
to take power over the direction of the network from big pools and put
it into the hands of thousands of individual miners. It's much easier to
convince people that changes to Bitcoin, like increasing the blocksize,
are directly impacting decentralization when individual miners are
seeing that happen to themselves.

## 10 June 2013

Self-described intelligence agent [John Dillon](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-June/002729.html) sends an email that miners have too much power to raise the blocksize.

```
It has been suggested that we leave the decision of what the blocksize to be
entirely up to miners. However this leaves a parameter that affects every
Bitcoin participant in the control of a small minority. Of course we can not
force miners to increase the blocksize if they choose to decrease it, because
the contents of the blocks they make are their decision and their decision
only. However proposals to leave the maximum size unlimited to allow miners to
force us to accept arbitrarily large blocks even if the will of the majority of
Bitcoin participants is that they wish to remain able to validate the
blockchain.

What we need is a way to balance this asymetrical power relationship.
```

In a later email sent on the same day, [John Dillon](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-June/002734.html) falsley claims that Satoshi Nakamoto never forsaw pool mining, ASICs, and was strongly against using GPUs.

```
Indeed it was. Which is why as GPU's came onto the scene Satoshi was strongly
against them. I have to wonder what he thinks of ASICs where just a handful of
companies control the supply of Bitcoin hashing power.

Satoshi also never forsaw pools, which are why just 2 or 3 people control the
majority of Bitcoin hashing power.
```

Another Bitcoiner [asks for evidence](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-June/002736.html) for this but John Dillon does not reply to him.

[Gavin Andresen](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-August/003127.html) publishes a todo list that includes working on papers explaining why the 1mb blocksize increase must be raised.

[Peter Todd](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-August/003139.html) replies that off-chain solutions will delay the need for raising the blocksize soon despite none really existing at the moment.

[Mike Hearn](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-August/003147.html) writes that Satoshi's vision was always to have millions of users supported by maybe 100,000 nodes.

[Peter Todd](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-August/003149.html) replies that Satoshi had bad economic judgement.

```
Appeal to authority. Stop bringing up Satoshi's "vision" - our understanding of
crypto-currencies has improved in the 4.5 years since Bitcoin was
released. Satoshi didn't even forsee pool mining, which says a lot about
his economic judgement.
```

Over time, the gap between those who think that Satoshi was correct and those who think they know better than Satoshi would grow.

A user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum that a version of [bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512)

The posting showed Gentoo output blocking a transaction with a SatoshiDice address, which had been blacklisted, and complains that Luke Dashjr is responsible.

>Enabling the stupidmoralnazi aka ljr [Luke Dashjr] use flag results in errors like these:

Luke replies "no sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?”

It turned out that Luke had quietly blacklisted the known addresses of several of the highest transaction-volume businesses in Bitcoin. At the time SatoshiDice in particular [was the most popular Bitcoin gambling site in the world.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-company-acquisitions-begin-gambling-site-satoshidice-sells-for-11-5m-126315-btc)

```

In the later discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called the businesses a [“DDoS attack on the bitcoin network“.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c7)

Another user rightly points out that this is nonsense and that the patch is censoring Bitcoin and [changing how users expect it to work.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c8)

>
>There is nothing protocol-wise which is invalid about the transactions coming from the sources which are being blacklisted by this patch...

>... this patch is actively censoring and changing the behaviors of bitcoin to no longer act the usual way as defined by the the official non-patched defaults.

He later writes that [SatoshiDice is being punished for being too popular.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c6)

>Just to want to clarify on why the censorship is happening:
>
>The (alleged) attack in question is nothing more than a popular business model which has been attractive and actively used to the point where a non-small amount of traffic was generated by the sites in question.

>
>Paraphrased: "Too popular, and therefore there is a risk of the bitcoin network running out of capacity because of such business plans and their subsequent usage of bitcoin as a method for conducting business operations"

Luke later posted an apology and [removed the patch.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c46)

## 06 October 2014

Gavin Andresen [publishes a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122517/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/) proposing that the 1MB limit be raised to allow for scalability.

He argues that the 1mb fix was always a temporary hack and that Satoshi always intended to raise the block size.

>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.

He also writes that the expectation of Bitcoin holders from the start has always been that Bitcoin would scale up and that meeting those expectations is the same as meeting the expectation that Bitcoin would never increase the coin limit.

>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

>As the Giga-blockchain and main-blockchain continue to grow from the fork, those actively attacking the Giga-Blockchain will create many transactions that allow their main-blockchain coins to duplicate over to the Giga-blockchain while remaining safely on the main-blockchain. The transactions that succeed can then be used to acquire more main-blockchain coins upon which the cycle repeats. Eventually the blockchain with the most financial resources behind it will continue to grow at a faster pace, while the other slowly, and eventually stops growing altogether.
>
>It will be impossible for the Giga-chain to keep 1:1 parity with the main chain from which it forks, they contain different transaction, although some may overlap. Here a user broadcasts a transaction with inputs originating on the Main-chain, and is eventually included in a block on the Giga-chain, but not on the Main-chain. The coin is essentially duplicated onto both chains.

## 07 February 2015

[‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallinger,](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435) explains on BitcoinTalk why Satoshi imposed a [1MB default block size]() to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks.

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees.

Mike Hearn writes a popular article explaining why [letting the Bitcoin blocks get full would be devesating to adoption of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32) and trust in its future. He predits the rise of an altcoin market as businesses look for new options besides Bitcoin.

>But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.

>I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept, the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative repercussions.

Bitcoin.org introduces an official ['position on hard-forks,'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894) which meant it would not promote XT.

>Bitcoin.org will not promote software or services that will leave the previous consensus because of a contentious hard fork attempt.

The move has support from Theymos, Cobra, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke Dashjr, and others according to the Github thread.

![Position on Hard Forks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/61096/8162837/d2c9b502-134d-11e5-9a8b-27c65c0e0356.png)

Developer Mike Hearn strongly cririsizes this as a move [towards centraliziation and thought control.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112121007)

>This is very disappointing David. You want to ensure new users don't learn about Bitcoin XT. Why not just say that outright?
>
>Your position is wrong and will just reduce bitcoin.org's utility as a place to learn important information.
>
>What's more, you are inherently supporting a status quo in which a tiny number of people can veto any change to Bitcoin regardless of how widely supported it is by the rest of the community. That's not decentralisation. And it is ultimately far more dangerous to Bitcoin. If you try and shut down the only method the community has to reject the decisions of this tiny group, you're effectively dooming the project to the whims of whoever happened to be around early on in the project and ended up with commit access.
>
>However, if you really want to "pick a side" in this debate like that, then given the wording of your policy if a >1mb chain wins you will have to replace Bitcoin Core completely and not mention it anywhere, as at that point, it would be the implementation leaving the consensus by attempting to produce a contentious hard fork (the 1mb only chain). So are you sure you thought this through? Are you ready for that pull request, if one day it comes?

Will Binns writes that this move will effectively [sway public opinion towards one side of the debate.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112123722)

>Bitcoin.org should try to say as non-bias as possible in the midst of publicly debated issues. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are coming to this site every day, many of which are new users learning about Bitcoin for the first time. For existing users in the space, this website is also an incredible resource in most cases.
>
>It seems like this post would be in an effort to sway public opinion more-so than anything else. It doesn't provide a complete context nor link to a wider array of information about the underlying issues it references so the reader can form their own opinion - it comes across as forcing a biased one.

Mike Hearn comments again that the clever wording in this policy—"previous consensus—means that [almost all the major payment processors, exchanges, and wallets would need to be deleted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112124088) in order to be consistent.

>Rereading the policy, there's one more reason this policy is suicide - it says you will delist any wallet or service that announces it will operate on the other side of the "previous consensus".
>
>Currently every single wallet bar GreenAddress that we've polled has told us they support bigger blocks.
>
>Additionally, every major payment processor we've talked to has also said that.
>
>Plus the major exchanges.
>
>So to be consistent with this policy you will have to delete every wallet and all major services (except GreenAddress) from the website. This would eliminate bitcoin.org as a useful place to learn about Bitcoin products and services, which is one of the key functions of the site!

He also correctly points out that raising the block size was always Satoshi's plan.

>I understand you are concerned about the notion of a contentious hard fork. I think you're wrong about the possible consequences though. It should be clear from the block chain when the change has reached a sufficient amount of mining power and at that point there would be plenty of time for services to upgrade before the fork actually happens. Nobody should lose any money and nobody should feel disenfranchised: they can just switch to the winning chain and carry on. They can always sell their coins before or after if they really believe that the plan Satoshi had all along is so bad.

After some back and forth, Mike concludes [the policy is entirely abitrary,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112136250) that most people support raising the blocksize including some Blockstream employees, and that not doing so will harm Bitcoin.

>Ah, so your policy is entirely arbitrary then.
>
>I can as well argue that in fact this situation is not contentious at all - as I said above, all major players agree on the need for larger blocks, indeed, even some Blockstream employees do (or say they do). It's really just a tiny number of people holding up progress at this point. So if you are going to decide that my definition of contentious is wrong and yours is right, just because "it's easy to say", then why have a policy at all? Why not just admit it's your opinion?
>
>Look. I don't mean to be antagonistic. I realise you are attempting to avoid harm to Bitcoin. But remember why Gavin and I are doing this - if the fork does not happen Bitcoin will suffer. You see this as some kind of one-sided deal: if a fork happens it might be bad and hurt Bitcoin, but if it doesn't happen there's no problem!
>
>I'm the developer of the first and still most widely used SPV wallets. Aaron Voisine is the developer of the most widely used SPV wallet on iOS. Both of us have reached the same conclusion about what will happen if capacity is not raised: it will hurt Bitcoin, a lot. Many others in the community have also reached that conclusion.
>
>By backing stasis you are not backing stability, or helping preserve Bitcoin's value. You are not taking a principled stand for a better development process. You are instead joining up with those who want to drive the network off a cliff. It is not bitcoin.org's place to make such decisions. Please reconsider this policy.

>Allow posts that promote hard forks in the sub. A hard fork to raise the hard limit has been part of the development plan for Bitcoin since 2010. Posts about it are entirely appropriate for this subreddit.

A now [deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h5f90/these_mods_need_to_be_changed_upvote_if_you_agree/) post [(archive)](https://archive.is/rum9c) on /r/bitcoin calling for the moderators to step down garnered more than 2,800 upvotes (91% upvoted), making it one of the highest-voted threads of /r/bitcoin history. The community demonstrated consensus (heh) that the current /r/bitcoin mod squad was corrupt, participating in censorship, and needed to go.

One user comments the following:

>Everytime I have something to say critical of bitcoin or something nice to say about an altcoin I get banned here. These mods censor conversation. It is disingenious to censor anything that isn't pro bitcoin. Stop the circle jerk. (and yes I love bitcoin but don't censor me fucks)

Another user comments that the censorship of Bitcoin XT topics is rallying the community to push back against them.

>The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community. We all rally against the censorship and mods by running XT. Thus quickly settling consensus rather than dragging it out over months. Maybe. Maybe

Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo submits a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nysearca-2017-06/nysearca201706-161046.htm) to the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask them to step in and protect consumers from attempts to create a new Bitcoin.

>I am Matt Corallo, a long-time developer of Bitcoin (around the 10th publicly recorded individual to contribute to the Bitcoin codebase), an expert on Bitcoin's operation, vocal Bitcoin advocate, and strong proponent of the availability of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP).
>
>I have very grave concerns with the proposed rules for the maintaining of Bitcoin deposits and the lack of consumer protection in the event of Bitcoin Network rule changes in the current filings.
>
>As described in the S-1 filing for the "Bitcoin Investment Trust" (BIT), a "permanent fork" of Bitcoin may occur when two groups of users disagree as to the rules which define the system (its "consensus rules"). More specifically, such a "permanent fork" is likely to occur when one group of users wish to make a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules, while another group does not. This leads to two cryptocurrencies, and may lead to significant ambiguity around which should be referred to as "Bitcoin".

An issue is opened on Github to [delist any company that signed the NYA.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1753) Cobra writes that they should [delist BitPay and Coinbase, any of their products, and issue an alert for potential customers.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1753#issuecomment-332300306)

>I believe the main economic actors involved in this NYA takeover attempt (Coinbase & Bitpay) are still very committed to going through with it. Nothing has changed in the last month.

>For now, let's just remove any mention of Coinbase and Bitpay (and their associated products), and put out an alert telling users to BEWARE of Coinbase and Bitpay because they plan on switching over to something that we believe isn't actual Bitcoin.

Cobra opens a Github issue for Bitcoin.org labeled [*Add Segwit2x Safety Alert.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824) The alert ostensibly warns users of hostile companies, but the list includes most of the oldest, most successful Bitcoin companies, and the real goal seems to be to scare or punish these companies for their stance on Segwit 2x.

>This adds a new alert warning users about storing any BTC in Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo. These companies continue ahead with their plan to hard fork away from consensus, and so this alert is necessary to make sure users are informed enough about the incoming threat.
>
>Thoughts? Feedback? I've tried to keep it fairly short, and I don't want this to grow into a huge complex document full of a million different things. I think the key part is to just tell people to get their coins off these dangerous services, and I think this alert accomplishes that pretty well.
>
>I've made this into a red alert because I think this incoming hard fork is possibly the greatest threat to Bitcoin, so a red warning is necessary to catch people's attention. I want as many as possible to know what these insidious companies are planning so we can prevent them quietly pushing it through. Raising awareness is key. I'm going to be suspicious of anyone changing this document in such a way as to make the issue seem like less of a danger and trying to "tone it down" without clear well thought out reasons.

Despite the unpopularity of Bitcoin.org's Segwit Safety Alert proposal, they [post on their blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171028193101/https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/denounce-segwit2x) their intentions to activate the alert in the coming days, along with a blacklist of companies that includes Coinbase, BitPay, Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, BTC.com and more. 

They also list 'guidelines' for companies to be removed from the list. The entire article is shared below.

>On 2017-10-11 at noon (UTC), Bitcoin.org is planning to publish a banner on every page of the site warning users about the risks of using services that will default to the so-called Segwit2x1 (S2X) contentious hard fork. S2X companies will be called out by name. To ensure that we only warn users against companies that will actually put user deposits at risk, we urge all companies to publicly clarify their stance before the above date, either by a highly-visible public statement or by commenting on Bitcoin.org issue #1835 (or by doing both).
>
>In particular, we need to know that:
>
>- The company will not under any circumstances list “Segwit2x” as “BTC” and/or “Bitcoin”. Note that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners, and miner actions cannot be used as a justification to redefine Bitcoin.
>
>- The company will not by default do anything that would deprive users of their bitcoins (by eg. using S2X software without addressing replay attacks2, selling user bitcoins automatically, crediting BTC deposits only as S2X deposits, etc.). Providing access to S2X-coins is acceptable, however.
>
>- The company will continue to provide normal service to Bitcoin (ie. non-S2X) users.
>
>Although bitcoin.org condemns contentious hard fork attempts such as S2X, we consider it tolerable for companies to support S2X in ways that do not contradict the above three points, such as by supporting both Bitcoin and S2X simultaneously as separate cryptocurrencies.
>
>By default, we will be using the following list of companies known to support S2X in our warning:

>1. “SegWit2x” has nothing to do with SegWit. SegWit is already activated, and was supported by an entirely different set of people.

The article is notable for many reasons, particularly the claim that "Segwit2x has nothing to do with Segwit."

[Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow tags the New York Department of Financial Services on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/916491407270879232?s=20) and asks if Coinbase is breaking any rules and engaging in fraud in supporting Segwit 2X.

The threat is clear: if you support Segwit 2X, Blockstream will use state regulatory bodies to punish you.

[The Segwit Safety Alert activates on Bitcoin.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029022533/https://bitcoin.org/en/) A red banner stating *Beware of Bitcoin's possible incompatibility with some major services* appears on every page.

![Segwit Safety Alert](https://i.imgur.com/Ghe8T21.png)

The linked article is shared in full below.

> **Summary**
>
>A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay have signed an agreement to adopt and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin sometime in November. A hard fork is a backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork is not supported by the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and is therefore a contentious hard fork. By adopting this hard fork, we believe the supporters of this agreement are shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.
>
>The signatories of this agreement wrongly believe that the currency created by adopting this contentious hard fork will eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore storing any BTC on services such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin. The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to download the latest version of Bitcoin Core and transfer out any BTC stored on services that are a signatory to this agreement. We have listed the businesses supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.
>
>For users who aren’t prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend a wallet such as GreenAddress, Electrum or TREZOR. Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info. However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after the hard fork. Any transactions you make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and “replayed” on the altcoin chain. If the coins on the contentious hard fork have any value, there will be methods you can use to “split” your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after the fork so you stay informed.
>
>**Mobile wallets**
>
>Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions. There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork. A majority of miners have pledged to support the contentious hard fork, therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true block chain. As a result of this, spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You will be vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.
>
>If the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets, however you should check multiple sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, /r/bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Forum to make sure that it’s safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions during and shortly after the hard fork.
>
>**After the fork**
>
>Blocks may be slower shortly after the hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before the hard fork date. A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by this contentious hard fork, you should exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. As the hard fork has very little replay protection, most transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network will also be valid on the hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.
>
>Some services may continue to present and name the altcoin created by this contentious hard fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals, miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. This hard fork being adopted by the signatories of this agreement achieves none of these things. It is a rushed and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community. As this new altcoin is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org will not list wallets and services that present this altcoin as “Bitcoin” or “BTC” to their users after the hard fork. These services have exited the Bitcoin system in a contentious manner and therefore are no longer useful to our visitors.

The article then lists again all the businesses that are supporting Segwit 2x.

Bitcoin Core Twitter and YouTube personality Richard Heart is allegedly [exposed online as an online spammer](reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/) who trained customers to [send millions of unsolicited emails](https://web.archive.org/web/20070821235025/http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00129.html) per day.

>I don't know how this flew under the radar but this is very interesting. Richard Heart was a nobody just a few short months ago. Literally nobody had heard of him until this year. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere he was someone where he himself claimed he was a "thought leader" and started creating these multi hour long videos where he would do nothing but talk shit about big blockers, talk shit about Bitcoin Cash and pump Core and Blockstream as much as possible...They outed him after discovering his past where he was a HUGE SPAMMER, running scams and hanging with murderers and criminals - I KID YOU NOT. He also has a bunch of fake identities including legit fake passports and fake IDs. This guy is not your run of the mill troll. He is a full on scammer with a shady as fck past!

Richard's [first Bitcoin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgNh43veB3Q) appeared right after the Bitcoin Cash hardfork and strongly critisized big-blockers while supporting Segwit. He would would go on make several popular videos during the height of the scaling wars invovlving BTC, Segwit 2X, and Bitcoin Cash.

Theymos creates a Github issue titled [*Policy to fight against "miners control Bitcoin" narrative.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issue-272347583) He expresses his concern as follows and asks that companies sign a pledge aggreeing that Bitcoin consensus rules are not defined by miners in order to be listed on Bitcoin.org.

>With the S2X nonsense, several companies said that miners control Bitcoin. This belief is one of the most dangerous threats to Bitcoin, since if most people think that, then Bitcoin ends up controlled by only a handful of people.
>
>Although this issue is mentioned in a few places on bitcoin.org, I've been thinking that bitcoin.org should somehow act against this more than it is already. For example, maybe bitcoin.org should require that wallets and services sign a very simple pledge that acknowledges that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners in order to be linked from bitcoin.org.

Hilariously, Cobra replies in agreement and [blames this *misconception* on the white paper itself,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issuecomment-342973983) which begs the question whether the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto is correct or they are. He then proposes the paper be rewritten.

>The whitepaper is to blame for all these dangerous beliefs. We seriously need to rewrite it, or produce a completely new whitepaper and call that the Bitcoin whitepaper.

The proposal appears to be wildly unpopular on Github.

[Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong](https://youtu.be/AIC62BkY4Co) says in an interview that Bitcoin broke his heart by not scaling as it should have.

>I think Bitcoin was my first true love, but it did break my heart a little bit...“Bitcoin ended up not scaling to be that..Right now, it’s ended up being a little more like digital gold. People are using it to kind of flee in times of uncertainty or to hold large amounts of it, but the transactions are too expensive on Bitcoin right now….It could be something on the order of one cent U.S. or less [each] to send every payment in the world...That’s where we need to get. Bitcoin, right now, only can do about three to five transactions a second. Visa does about 4,000 a second, so we’ve got a couple of orders of magnitude to go.

[Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments citing extreme volatility in fee prices.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613)

>In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin.

In interview in CoinTelegraph, Bitcoin Core supporter Max Keiser tells people to [use an altcoin, Dash, if they want a payment system.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/steam-stops-accepting-bitcoin-payments-citing-extreme-volatility-fees)

[theymos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7nz69v/can_we_get_a_link_to_the_whitepaper_in_the_sidebar/ds61skm/) replies to a comment about adding the Bitcoin whitepaper to the sidebar of r/Bitcoin. He says that the whitepaper is a bad way to learn about Bitcoin.

>The paper is not a good introduction to Bitcoin. It was written in 2008 (before Bitcoin even existed) in order to convince users of the cryptography mailing list that the idea was workable. It was never a complete description of Bitcoin, and it was never good for newbies. I was very familiar with crypto and P2P when I first discovered Bitcoin, and it took me a while to fully understand the paper even with the benefit of being able to ask Satoshi about any questions I had. It is especially not good for newbies 10 years later, when the very language we use to talk about these things has changed substantially. The paper is a historical artifact, very interesting and not inaccurate, but very very bad for actually gaining technical understanding of anything.

[Stripe ends its support for Bitcoin, citing the block sizes filling up and the lack of utility, and therefore interest, in Bitcoin payments.](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support) While Stripe states they don't necessarily disagree with the Bitcoin community not raising the block size, they no longer have any reason to work with it.

>Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.
>
>Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it’s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we’re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)
>
>This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.
>
>Because of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.
>
>Therefore, starting today, we are winding down support for Bitcoin payments. Over the next three months we will work with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition before we stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23, 2018.

Popular Bitcoin podcast host, Peter McCormack, asks in r/bitcoin if someone can help him understand both sides of the scaling debate. [His post is immediately deleted.](https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/996110493793173504?s=20)

Longtime Bitcoiner [Bryan Micon comments](https://twitter.com/BryanMicon/status/996384902089199616?s=20) in frustration and notes that r/bitcoin has become a bubble:

>Censoring the mere mention of an altcoin, in a legitimate post discussing Bitcoin vs. said altcoin, is what's wrong with r/bitcoin.
>
>Missing the old days where ideas flowed freely there.

>Now it's an echo chamber where wrongthink is quickly swept away.

Blockstream's Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow asks for an [SEC investigation](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/976628574919671808?s=20) into CNBC for discussing Bitcoin Cash and jail time.

>Nice selective timeframe to pump the $BCH altcoin to your viewers. May as well make a graphic putting it on a throne for dramatic effect right? Seriously, if these guys at @CNBC aren’t in jail by year end, someone isn’t doing their job.  @SEC_Enforcement

He asks if there are any [current investigations.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998650624370663425?s=20)

>My question is if there are any pending investigations into @CNBCFastMoney by @SEC_News for @BKBrianKelly and other staff pumping and dumping $BCH, or accepting bribes to market the altcoin to investors.

He also [asks for material he can send the SEC directly.](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998762417470373888?s=20)

>Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment. 

Blockstream 'contractor' and Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr joins in and tells a now-deleted Bitcoin Cash account that [Bitcoin Cashers will be jailed.](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/976677047589396480?s=20)

A [r/Bitcoin user] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pfdjh/bitcoinorgs_new_version_is_live/e0bulzn/)comments on the new Bitcoin.org that removing CoinBase and BitPay is "insane and political."

>STRONGLY DISAGREE. What is the point of this site? To educate beginners right? Onboard new users? How does removal of the two biggest payment processors help with that?

The post is very popular, and [theymos replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8pfdjh/bitcoinorgs_new_version_is_live/e0c90cm/) in a heavily downvoted comment that CoinBase and BitPay have tried to take over Bitcoin.

>They repeatedly supported attempts to take over Bitcoin, such as "NYA". Bitcoin was created to change the world, not to make people lots of money, and bitcoin.org does not need to point people to companies which have proven that they are fundamentally opposed to the principles behind Bitcoin just so that it's easier to "onboard" people. That's pump-and-dump thinking, not Bitcoin thinking.

Cobra creates a [Github issue proposing to redo the long-standing informational video on Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2535#issue-343348067) From his comment, we can tell his concern is that users would think that Bitcoin is meant to be used for payments.

>...Claims fees are low which is not necessarily true...
>
>Overall the video just feels... empty. Anyone who watches it won't even get close to a true understanding of what Bitcoin is. It just presents Bitcoin as something slightly better than PayPal. I think it's better if we get a new more up to date video made.

It is notable that nobody had ever complained about the video and the impression it left newcomers with about Bitcoin for years.

Cobra creates a Github issue to discuss [relisting companies that were removed from Bitcoin.org for supporting the 2mb hard fork block size increase.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) His reasoning is that the delisting *worked* to stop the increase and that these companies are unlikely to try it again.

>After the whole S2X situation, we removed links to many of the businesses that had signed the NYA. The site doesn't mention Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay, BTC.com, etc. I think enough time has passed for us to reconsider the situation. The removal and subsequent period of not linking to them was reasonable, since these companies could have attempted another contentious hard fork shortly after S2X failed, but time has shown that they've completely failed and given up at taking over Bitcoin, and are unlikely to try again.
>
>I believe that attacks on Bitcoin through manipulating large economic actors like Coinbase are a thing of the past. 

Theymos [replies and says they should not be relisted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) unless they publicly apologize and issue a statement on why they were wrong.

>As far as I can tell, if they don't do anything like that again, it'll be because it's become too difficult now, not because they've learned from it. So I wouldn't re-add them unless they admit their mistakes and in particular acknowledge that Bitcoin is not governed, especially not by miners.'

Blockstream announces their release of the Liquid full node binaries & source code and claims that ["any user can join the #P2P #LiquidNetwork by operating a full node, in order to trustlessly use the #sidechain just like with the #Bitcoin"](https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1059886244853886987)

Former co-founder of Blockstrearm Matt Corallo tweets that [this is a lie](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1060101587584991233?s=20).

>Uhhhh, I don't really know how to describe this use of the word "trustless" except "lie". Maybe someone is trying to redefine the word?

Samson Mow cheers and threatens Bitcoin Cash Association creator Paul Wasensteiner's arrest and [tags the SEC on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/excellion/status/1078051212052684800)

>I continue to believe that Bitcoin’s *failure* to raise its blocksize by a significant amount in 2016–17 was a travesty and a great violation of many people’s expectations of the protocol, and one that led to more total losses due to excess txfees than the amount lost in the MtGox hack), but this is the argument that you need to be arguing against.

Former Blockstream Cofounder Matt Corallo blocks Samson Mow on Twitter, calling it the "best decision" he's ever made and says ["I'm honestly pretty embarrassed to have helped cofound @Blockstream."](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133040768531214338)

He strongly crisizes the [troll culture popular at the company.](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1133042374320562177?s=20)

Greg Maxwell [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lightning_Network&diff=prev&oldid=930392324) to have Bitcoin XT scrubbed from the Bitcoin Wikipedia page.

```
I feel like this subject could get adequately covered as 
part of a broader article on consensusless decenteralized 
payment systems, but considering that lightning is the only
such system with even moderately wide deployment and that 
there aren't a lot of secondary sources on the broader idea... 
that gets in the way of covering it that way.  There are a lot 
of bit-rotten obscure cryptocurrency articles that should probably 
be [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
