title: Timeline History of Bitcoin Scaling
---

## FAQ (maxis read this first)

**bcash is dead. Bitcoin moon. You lose. Why are you writing this?** I'll be the first person to admit in 2020 that the big-block Bitcoin fork experiment may be dead. Drama, network splits, bad decisions, and failure to grow quickly enough have made me less bullish on the success of Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV than ever. But the failure of these experiments does not mean that Bitcoin itself shouldn't have continued along its intended scaling path, it only means that bootstrapping a minority chain may be impossible. Regardless, it is not my intention to prove that Bitcoin should not have changed to become something different than what Satoshi Nakamoto intended. It is only to document the history of how it changed, and to demonstrate that it was not technical or economic arguments that captured Bitcoin, but a social attack of lies, propaganda, threats, censorship, state action, and more.

**Are you a shitcoiner?** No, I believe only one coin can "win" and that the coin that wins will almost certainly be some version Bitcoin with the same database going back to the genesis block. I would not be surprised if BTC is that coin. I would however, be disappointed unless I saw serious improvements over the next few decades. Bitcoin promised to be a lot more than what BTC has thus far delivered. This document, essay, timeline—whatever you want to call it—will show that.

**Who the hell even are you?** Armchair researcher. I have no special qualifications whatsoever other than that I read a lot more than most people and have, not to flatter myself too much, a *very* good memory. But all more sources are cited and you can judge them for yourself. 

## Methods and Disclaimers

**Not for goldfish.** This is not a short narrative or listicle. It's a *very* long data-dump covering over a decade of history. It is organised chronologically and can be read straight through or by jumping around to dates that interest you. There is a *lot* of material here which has never before appeared together, and if I suspect the main criticism of this paper will be that I was rather not selective enough. If you want shorter essays, I can recommend John Blocke's fantastic essay on the [censorship of r/bitcoin](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and Daniel Morgan's excellent [scaling debate timeline](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada). If you're new to the history of Bitcoin, those are also good places to start before wade through this.

**No narrative claims.** I'm deliberately leaving out editorializing about grand conspiracies to co-opt Bitcoin. I have my own thoughts on that but in my own experience, starting with those claims tends to make people ignore the well-documented facts that show, whether the effort was intentional, coordinated, or not, it was corrupt, coercive, and effective. Instead I invite readers to form their own conclusions from the timeline of evidence and I hope people may see patterns that I did not. All of that said, I won't leave out information just because it lends itself to a particular theory. If I believe it is true, I have included it.

**Always incomplete.** I may add new material to this document in the future or edit existing material. If the edits are trivial—spelling, dates, typos, etc, I won't make a note of them. If the edits are because a piece of information I included as true was fundamentally wrong, I will do a strikethrough and add a linked footnote with a correction.

**Goals.** I hope writers, filmmakes, researchers and other creators will be able to make use of the information here in their own projects. I have no delusions that this paper itself will be a giant hit—it is much too long for that—but the material here could fuel documentaries, books, essays, art, research and a lot moe.

## 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman. He has demonstrated this in numerous ways. The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time. No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

The discussion is one of the incredible coincidences in the history of electronic cash, because it takes place nearly 13 years to the day before Bitcoin was launched! What is more, James A. Donald was one of the first people to respond to Satoshi Nakamoto's announcement.

## 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

## 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

## 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

## May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

## ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

## 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia,](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/) many of the same tactics he would later use in Bitcoin.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

## 16 April 2008

Early Bitcoin code generated by Satoshi prior to the release of Bitcoin shows [scraps of code for an online poker game,](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/uibase.cpp) suggesting Satoshi intended from the start that Bitcoin would be useable for small online payments.

---

## 22 August 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto [emails Wei Dai](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto) to ask him about adding his paper b-money to what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. The draft is titled: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.

## 14 February 2010

Satoshi deletes what appears to be unfinished rudimtentary code for a p2p marketplace in a commit labeled ["strip out unfinished product, review and market stuff."](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cc4b78d59f566ff43881f57797a16ce45eb1b80ez) Though the code was never finished, it suggests Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be used in commerce early on.

Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn [commented](http://eigenjoy.com/2014/05/17/bitcoin-2014-amsterdam-day-two-notes/) on this years later.

>When Satoshi launched bitcoin he was working on a p2p marketplace and you would be able to rate buyers and sellers and the weight would be according to how much mining they had done. He realized there were more important priorities.

## 14 July 2010

A <code>max_block_size</code> [value of 1MB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2614) set on the client.

## 22 July 2010

The Bitcoin.org website on [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094110/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/) lists the main advantages of Bitcoin on the homepage. In bold, it says:

> Bitcoin transactions are practically free, whereas credit cards and online payment systems typically cost 1-5% per transaction plus various other merchant fees up to hundreds of dollars.

## 19 September 2010

After some discussion, Hal Finney, Satoshi (Bitcoin’s creator), and the user ‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallingerr, on Bitcointalk imposed a [1MB default block size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522) to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks. [Cryddit below explains why this limit was put in place:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435)

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees.

## 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

The original threads about the Silk Road on BitcoinTalk are [revealed to have been deleted,](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.0).

## 29 June 2011

One early Bitcoiner comments that the Bitcoin [forums are becoming a horrible place to discuss things](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg304289#msg304289) because of moderators censoring old threads and trolls are shouting people down.

>forum.bitcoin.org is the single worst place on the internet to talk about bitcoin. Dissenting voices are regularly shouted down or dismissed as trolls. Moderators are now deleting longstanding threads of great interest. The worst part is, in bitcoin-forumland, the internet is nothing but America.

## 01 July 2011 

A forum user complains about the [recent censorship](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg313015#msg313015) on the Bitcoin forums and says he expects more in the future.

>I will not bother contributing to this forum if my posts or even whole threads are going to be removed based on short-term goals by people controlling Bitcoin. Expect to be defaced in future.

## 19 July 2011

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the story years later: 

>Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.
>
>This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.
>
>Theymos wasn't much better - wouldn't re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.
>
>After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops. I figured I at least deserved some kind of explanation, let alone my modship (which, let's face it is a somewhat useful position in the btc world).

## 30 July 2011

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

## 18 April 2013 

Someone by the name of John Dillon (john.dillon892@googlemail.com) [emails](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/30738521/) the bitcoin-development email list offering a $500USD reward to anyone who implements a transaction replacement-by-fee patch for Bitcoin.

John Dillon claimed in [leaked private emails](https://archive.is/PK1I1) that his day job is high up in a US intelligence agency. He says that he doesn't like what the government is doing and wants to make up for it by helping Bitcoin.

Peter Todd writes on BitcoinTalk that he is [considering claiming the bounty himself.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179612.msg1873593#msg1873593)

## 17 May 2013

Peter Todd releases a highly downvoted video on why the [blocksize limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.0) that is [paid for](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2292636#msg2292636) by the psuednonymous US intelligence agent John Dillon according to the [leaked emails.](https://archive.is/PK1I1)

The YouTube responses are mostly negative and some are worth looking more at.

## 28 May 2013

In the ongoing discussion about the Peter Todd video, a forum member [points out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2293256#msg2293256) that Peter Todd's limited blocks + high fees solution will lead to proprietary payment networks, a sort of PayPal 2.0 rather than what Bitcoin was intended to be.

>This is just my opinion, but I think the vast majority of people would prefer a fully automated p2p network that's made up of thousands of nodes operated by enterprises, than a fully automated p2p network with hundreds of thousands of nodes operated by hobbyists, but with the disadvantage that you need to trust third party payment processors for any kind of real world use of currency.
>
>If we're going to use proprietary networks (and they have to be networks to avoid expensive on-chain transactions) to transfer bitcoin credit, instead of bitcoin itself around, we can just use banks, or some successor to e-gold or something.
>
>Limiting Bitcoin to 7 tps in my opinion virtually guarantees it will never have significant impact, because I believe people will opt for government-regulated networks, or alternative blockchains, if Bitcoin, as a p2p network, loses its transaction fee advantage.
>
>The 1 MB cap was put in place as a temporary measure, until a better way to control transaction spam was found. Trying to make the limit permanent is trying to change the vision of Bitcoin as originally conceived.

[Gavin Andresen writes](http://azure.erisian.com.au/~aj/tmp/irc/log-2013-08-30.html) that he suspects John Dillon is trying to hurt Bitcoin.

## 18 September 2013

Theymos writes in a now [deleted post](https://archive.is/YAYq6) that a handful of moderators should not control "truth" on the Bitcoin forums.

>The free and open discussions on this forum help individuals and the Bitcoin community achieve Truth. Everyone has some wisdom or knowledge to contribute to a discussion, and everyone who reads the discussion and gains that knowledge gets closer to the Truth. This is much more effective than having truth dictated by a handful of moderators or voted on by an electorate.

This is an important point to remember because we will see in the coming years that Theymos starts doing exactly the opposite with devestating effects.

**The same day:** Luke Dashjr creates a Github issue to [remove any mention of micropayments from Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/247#issue-19702662)

>Bitcoin is not a micro-payment system. Until someone creates one that works with Bitcoin reasonably, it probably shouldn't be mentioned as a feature.

## 16 November 2013

Some of John Dillon's [emails leaked in an alleged hack.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.0)

The emails prove that someone who *claimed* to be US intelligence agent was instrumental in funding the video Peter Todd made about keeping the Bitcoin blocks small. He also asks about potentially hiring Peter Todd to implement some "important" Bitcoin features. Some selections from the leak are provided below.

>Please don't make this public, but my day job involves intelligence, and I'm in a relatively high position.

>To clarify Keep Bitcoin Free! is Peter's project, not mine. I only contributed funds and offered to let him use my name publicly as a supporter.

>I see that Peter Todd recently completed his audit report, even writing a small patch for Litecoin. Could you comment a bit on how that process went? I and someone else may want to hire him directly, as opposed to the bounties I've offered before, to implement some Bitcoin features and we want to get a sense of how it all went.

Peter Todd himself wrote that John Dillon creeped him out a bit and seemed to be obsessed with him.

>I know, I'll admit he kinda creeps me out a bit sometimes... he's admitted he reads all my posts.

## 05 October 2014

A user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum that a version of [bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512)

The posting showed Gentoo output blocking a transaction with a SatoshiDice address, which had been blacklisted, and complains that Luke Dashjr is responsible.

>Enabling the stupidmoralnazi aka ljr [Luke Dashjr] use flag results in errors like these:

>A currency is worthless the moment you declare that you can use it to buy a bible but not the korean because we don't like that one.

Luke replies "no sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?”

It turned out that Luke had quietly blacklisted the known addresses of several of the highest transaction-volume businesses in Bitcoin. At the time SatoshiDice in particular [was the most popular Bitcoin gambling site in the world.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-company-acquisitions-begin-gambling-site-satoshidice-sells-for-11-5m-126315-btc)

The [relevant part of the code](https://pastebin.com/4xu8avtZ) is below:

+    {0xda5dde84, 0xda5dde94, "Lucky Bit"},
+};
```

In the later discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called the businesses a [“DDoS attack on the bitcoin network“.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c7)

Another user rightly points out that this is nonsense and that the patch is censoring Bitcoin and [changing how users expect it to work.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c8)

>No, it's really not a DoS attack.
>
>There isn't a single reputable journalist or non-fringe blogger who refers to the popularity of the business model of satoshi dice and the other blocked businesses as a "DoS attack"
>
>There is nothing protocol-wise which is invalid about the transactions coming from the sources which are being blacklisted by this patch...

>... this patch is actively censoring and changing the behaviors of bitcoin to no longer act the usual way as defined by the the official non-patched defaults.

He later writes that [SatoshiDice is being punished for being too popular.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c6)

Gavin Andresen [publishes a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122517/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/) proposing that the 1MB limit be raised to allow for scalability.

He argues that the 1mb fix was always a temporary hack and that Satoshi always intended to raise the block size.

>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.

He also writes that the expectation of Bitcoin holders from the start has always been that Bitcoin would scale up and that meeting those expectations is the same as meeting the expectation that Bitcoin would never increase the coin limit.

>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

[*Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains*](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) is published. The paper

>Because sidechains are still block chains independent of bitcoin, they are free to experiment with new transaction designs, trust models, economic models, asset issuance semantics, or cryptographic features.

The paper is co-authored by Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille.

[Greg Maxwell writes in an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k3u97/we_are_bitcoin_sidechain_paper_authors_adam_back/clhoxvu/) about the paper that he is looking at sidechains as a way to scale Bitcoin without raising the blocksize.

Mircea Popescu [describes a plan to manipulate the market and financially harm anyone supporting Bitcoin XT.](http://btcbase.org/log/?date=07-01-2015#967332) The attack is described further in a [blog post](http://qntra.net/2015/01/the-hard-fork-missile-crisis/) by another Bitcoin Core supporter.

>As the Giga-blockchain and main-blockchain continue to grow from the fork, those actively attacking the Giga-Blockchain will create many transactions that allow their main-blockchain coins to duplicate over to the Giga-blockchain while remaining safely on the main-blockchain. The transactions that succeed can then be used to acquire more main-blockchain coins upon which the cycle repeats. Eventually the blockchain with the most financial resources behind it will continue to grow at a faster pace, while the other slowly, and eventually stops growing altogether.
>
>It will be impossible for the Giga-chain to keep 1:1 parity with the main chain from which it forks, they contain different transaction, although some may overlap. Here a user broadcasts a transaction with inputs originating on the Main-chain, and is eventually included in a block on the Giga-chain, but not on the Main-chain. The coin is essentially duplicated onto both chains.
>
>Those siding with the wrong chain who end up accepting duplicated transactions from the other chain, such as a purchase from an exchange running on the losing blockchain, will lose those coins when the dust settles. No war is without casulties, the Great Blockchain Civil War will be no different.

## 12 January 2015

In response to Gavin Andresen's argument that Bitcoin's block size must be raised so more people can use it, Mircea Popescu writes in an unhinged rant that [Bitcoin is not for poor people.](http://trilema.com/2015/lets-address-some-of-the-more-common-pseudo-arguments-raised-by-the-very-stupid-people-that-like-the-gavin-scamcoin-proposal/)

>Bitcoin isn't for everybody...
>
>Should blocks ever become full, older coinbases will be prioritized over newer coinbases, and larger mining fees and transactions prioritized over smaller mining fees and smaller transactions. This means that someone who wishes to pay for very little with Bitcoin will be forced to use something else, so to speak is forced to "give his seat" to someone richer. This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, unversally, as a matter of course.
>
>You may not like this, but that is entirely an emotional problem of yours, which you're welcome to resolve any way you can: stop being poor, take a lot of pills, whatever...
>
>Run along now, back to playing in the mud with the other naked kids in your village. Bitcoin's just not for your kind.

He also asserts without evidence that Gavin Andresen is a mole for the US Government and threatens to "humiliatingly defeat" him.

## 07 May 2015 

Mike Hearn writes a popular article explaining why [letting the Bitcoin blocks get full would be devesating to adoption of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32) and trust in its future. He predits the rise of an altcoin market as businesses look for new options besides Bitcoin.

>But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.

>I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept, the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative repercussions.

Chinese miners signed a statement that they want [8MB blocks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a0n4m/why_upgrade_to_8mb_but_not_20mb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Signatories included the large mining companies F2pool, BTCChina, Antpool, Huobi, and BW.

In an article translated on Medium, the miners argue:

>If the current network is incapable of supporting blocks larger than 1MB, then Core’s insistence on the block size limit is understandable. But actually, even with the Great Firewall in place, Chinese mining pools have all said they want an 8MB block size.

Bitcoin.org introduces an official ['position on hard-forks,'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894) which meant it would not promote XT.

>Bitcoin.org will not promote software or services that will leave the previous consensus because of a contentious hard fork attempt.

The move has support from Theymos, Cobra, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke Dashjr, and others according to the Github thread.

![Position on Hard Forks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/61096/8162837/d2c9b502-134d-11e5-9a8b-27c65c0e0356.png)

Developer Mike Hearn strongly cririsizes this as a move [towards centraliziation and thought control.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112121007)

>This is very disappointing David. You want to ensure new users don't learn about Bitcoin XT. Why not just say that outright?
>
>Your position is wrong and will just reduce bitcoin.org's utility as a place to learn important information.
>
>What's more, you are inherently supporting a status quo in which a tiny number of people can veto any change to Bitcoin regardless of how widely supported it is by the rest of the community. That's not decentralisation. And it is ultimately far more dangerous to Bitcoin. If you try and shut down the only method the community has to reject the decisions of this tiny group, you're effectively dooming the project to the whims of whoever happened to be around early on in the project and ended up with commit access.
>
>However, if you really want to "pick a side" in this debate like that, then given the wording of your policy if a >1mb chain wins you will have to replace Bitcoin Core completely and not mention it anywhere, as at that point, it would be the implementation leaving the consensus by attempting to produce a contentious hard fork (the 1mb only chain). So are you sure you thought this through? Are you ready for that pull request, if one day it comes?

Will Binns writes that this move will effectively [sway public opinion towards one side of the debate.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112123722)

>Bitcoin.org should try to say as non-bias as possible in the midst of publicly debated issues. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are coming to this site every day, many of which are new users learning about Bitcoin for the first time. For existing users in the space, this website is also an incredible resource in most cases.
>
>It seems like this post would be in an effort to sway public opinion more-so than anything else. It doesn't provide a complete context nor link to a wider array of information about the underlying issues it references so the reader can form their own opinion - it comes across as forcing a biased one.

Mike Hearn comments again that the clever wording in this policy—"previous consensus—means that [almost all the major payment processors, exchanges, and wallets would need to be deleted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112124088) in order to be consistent.

>Rereading the policy, there's one more reason this policy is suicide - it says you will delist any wallet or service that announces it will operate on the other side of the "previous consensus".
>
>Currently every single wallet bar GreenAddress that we've polled has told us they support bigger blocks.
>
>Additionally, every major payment processor we've talked to has also said that.
>
>Plus the major exchanges.
>
>So to be consistent with this policy you will have to delete every wallet and all major services (except GreenAddress) from the website. This would eliminate bitcoin.org as a useful place to learn about Bitcoin products and services, which is one of the key functions of the site!

He also correctly points out that raising the block size was always Satoshi's plan.

>I understand you are concerned about the notion of a contentious hard fork. I think you're wrong about the possible consequences though. It should be clear from the block chain when the change has reached a sufficient amount of mining power and at that point there would be plenty of time for services to upgrade before the fork actually happens. Nobody should lose any money and nobody should feel disenfranchised: they can just switch to the winning chain and carry on. They can always sell their coins before or after if they really believe that the plan Satoshi had all along is so bad.

After some back and forth, Mike concludes [the policy is entirely abitrary,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112136250) that most people support raising the blocksize including some Blockstream employees, and that not doing so will harm Bitcoin.

>Ah, so your policy is entirely arbitrary then.
>
>I can as well argue that in fact this situation is not contentious at all - as I said above, all major players agree on the need for larger blocks, indeed, even some Blockstream employees do (or say they do). It's really just a tiny number of people holding up progress at this point. So if you are going to decide that my definition of contentious is wrong and yours is right, just because "it's easy to say", then why have a policy at all? Why not just admit it's your opinion?
>
>Look. I don't mean to be antagonistic. I realise you are attempting to avoid harm to Bitcoin. But remember why Gavin and I are doing this - if the fork does not happen Bitcoin will suffer. You see this as some kind of one-sided deal: if a fork happens it might be bad and hurt Bitcoin, but if it doesn't happen there's no problem!
>
>I'm the developer of the first and still most widely used SPV wallets. Aaron Voisine is the developer of the most widely used SPV wallet on iOS. Both of us have reached the same conclusion about what will happen if capacity is not raised: it will hurt Bitcoin, a lot. Many others in the community have also reached that conclusion.
>
>By backing stasis you are not backing stability, or helping preserve Bitcoin's value. You are not taking a principled stand for a better development process. You are instead joining up with those who want to drive the network off a cliff. It is not bitcoin.org's place to make such decisions. Please reconsider this policy.

The issue is merged on Github and the page goes live the following day.

A now [deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h5f90/these_mods_need_to_be_changed_upvote_if_you_agree/) post [(archive)](https://archive.is/rum9c) on /r/bitcoin calling for the moderators to step down garnered more than 2,800 upvotes (91% upvoted), making it one of the highest-voted threads of /r/bitcoin history. The community demonstrated consensus (heh) that the current /r/bitcoin mod squad was corrupt, participating in censorship, and needed to go.

One user comments the following:

>Everytime I have something to say critical of bitcoin or something nice to say about an altcoin I get banned here. These mods censor conversation. It is disingenious to censor anything that isn't pro bitcoin. Stop the circle jerk. (and yes I love bitcoin but don't censor me fucks)

Another user comments that the censorship of Bitcoin XT topics is rallying the community to push back against them.

>The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community. We all rally against the censorship and mods by running XT. Thus quickly settling consensus rather than dragging it out over months. Maybe. Maybe
