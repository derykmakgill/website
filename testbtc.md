## 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman. He has demonstrated this in numerous ways. The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time. No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

## 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

## 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

## 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

---

## May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

## ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

## 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia,](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/) many of the same tactics he would later use in Bitcoin.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

## 16 April 2008

Early Bitcoin code generated by Satoshi prior to the release of Bitcoin shows [scraps of code for an online poker game,](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/uibase.cpp) suggesting Satoshi intended from the start that Bitcoin would be useable for small online payments.

---

## 22 August 2008

Satoshi Nakamoto [emails Wei Dai](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto) to ask him about adding his paper b-money to what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. The draft is titled: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.

## 16 June 2011

The original threads about the Silk Road on BitcoinTalk are [revealed to have been deleted,](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.0).

---

## 29 June 2011

One early Bitcoiner comments that the Bitcoin [forums are becoming a horrible place to discuss things](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg304289#msg304289) because of moderators censoring old threads and trolls are shouting people down.

>forum.bitcoin.org is the single worst place on the internet to talk about bitcoin. Dissenting voices are regularly shouted down or dismissed as trolls. Moderators are now deleting longstanding threads of great interest. The worst part is, in bitcoin-forumland, the internet is nothing but America.

---

## 01 July 2011 

A forum user complains about the [recent censorship](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg313015#msg313015) on the Bitcoin forums and says he expects more in the future.

>I will not bother contributing to this forum if my posts or even whole threads are going to be removed based on short-term goals by people controlling Bitcoin. Expect to be defaced in future.

---

## 19 July 2011

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the story years later: 

>Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.
>
>This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.
>
>Theymos wasn't much better - wouldn't re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.
>
>After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops. I figured I at least deserved some kind of explanation, let alone my modship (which, let's face it is a somewhat useful position in the btc world).

## 18 April 2013 

Someone by the name of John Dillon (john.dillon892@googlemail.com) [emails](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/30738521/) the bitcoin-development email list offering a $500USD reward to anyone who implements a transaction replacement-by-fee patch for Bitcoin.

John Dillon claimed in [leaked private emails](https://archive.is/PK1I1) that his day job is high up in a US intelligence agency. He says that he doesn't like what the government is doing and wants to make up for it by helping Bitcoin.

Peter Todd writes on BitcoinTalk that he is [considering claiming the bounty himself.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179612.msg1873593#msg1873593)

## 17 May 2013

Peter Todd releases a highly downvoted video on why the [blocksize limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.0) that is [paid for](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2292636#msg2292636) by the psuednonymous US intelligence agent John Dillon according to the [leaked emails.](https://archive.is/PK1I1)

The YouTube responses are mostly negative and some are worth looking more at.

## 28 May 2013

In the ongoing discussion about the Peter Todd video, a forum member [points out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2293256#msg2293256) that Peter Todd's limited blocks + high fees solution will lead to proprietary payment networks, a sort of PayPal 2.0 rather than what Bitcoin was intended to be.

>This is just my opinion, but I think the vast majority of people would prefer a fully automated p2p network that's made up of thousands of nodes operated by enterprises, than a fully automated p2p network with hundreds of thousands of nodes operated by hobbyists, but with the disadvantage that you need to trust third party payment processors for any kind of real world use of currency.
>
>If we're going to use proprietary networks (and they have to be networks to avoid expensive on-chain transactions) to transfer bitcoin credit, instead of bitcoin itself around, we can just use banks, or some successor to e-gold or something.
>
>Limiting Bitcoin to 7 tps in my opinion virtually guarantees it will never have significant impact, because I believe people will opt for government-regulated networks, or alternative blockchains, if Bitcoin, as a p2p network, loses its transaction fee advantage.
>
>The 1 MB cap was put in place as a temporary measure, until a better way to control transaction spam was found. Trying to make the limit permanent is trying to change the vision of Bitcoin as originally conceived.

## 30 August 2013

[Gavin Andresen writes](http://azure.erisian.com.au/~aj/tmp/irc/log-2013-08-30.html) that he suspects John Dillon is trying to hurt Bitcoin.

>I've started to suspect jdillon is a very sophisticated troll with the ulterior motive of destroying bitcoin

---

## 18 September 2013

Theymos writes in a now [deleted post](https://archive.is/YAYq6) that a handful of moderators should not control "truth" on the Bitcoin forums.

>The free and open discussions on this forum help individuals and the Bitcoin community achieve Truth. Everyone has some wisdom or knowledge to contribute to a discussion, and everyone who reads the discussion and gains that knowledge gets closer to the Truth. This is much more effective than having truth dictated by a handful of moderators or voted on by an electorate.

This is an important point to remember because we will see in the coming years that Theymos starts doing exactly the opposite with devestating effects.

**The same day:** Luke Dashjr creates a Github issue to [remove any mention of micropayments from Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/247#issue-19702662)

>Bitcoin is not a micro-payment system. Until someone creates one that works with Bitcoin reasonably, it probably shouldn't be mentioned as a feature.

---

## 16 November 2013

Some of John Dillon's [emails leaked in an alleged hack.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.0)

The emails prove that someone who *claimed* to be US intelligence agent was instrumental in funding the video Peter Todd made about keeping the Bitcoin blocks small. He also asks about potentially hiring Peter Todd to implement some "important" Bitcoin features. Some selections from the leak are provided below.

>Please don't make this public, but my day job involves intelligence, and I'm in a relatively high position.

>To clarify Keep Bitcoin Free! is Peter's project, not mine. I only contributed funds and offered to let him use my name publicly as a supporter.

>I see that Peter Todd recently completed his audit report, even writing a small patch for Litecoin. Could you comment a bit on how that process went? I and someone else may want to hire him directly, as opposed to the bounties I've offered before, to implement some Bitcoin features and we want to get a sense of how it all went.

Peter Todd himself wrote that John Dillon creeped him out a bit and seemed to be obsessed with him.

>I know, I'll admit he kinda creeps me out a bit sometimes... he's admitted he reads all my posts.

## 05 October 2014

A user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum that a version of [bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512)

The posting showed Gentoo output blocking a transaction with a SatoshiDice address, which had been blacklisted, and complains that Luke Dashjr is responsible.

>Enabling the stupidmoralnazi aka ljr [Luke Dashjr] use flag results in errors like these:
>

>
>A currency is worthless the moment you declare that you can use it to buy a bible but not the korean because we don't like that one.

Luke replies "no sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?”

It turned out that Luke had quietly blacklisted the known addresses of several of the highest transaction-volume businesses in Bitcoin. At the time SatoshiDice in particular [was the most popular Bitcoin gambling site in the world.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-company-acquisitions-begin-gambling-site-satoshidice-sells-for-11-5m-126315-btc)

The [relevant part of the code](https://pastebin.com/4xu8avtZ) is below:
	
```

+    {0x74db3700, 0x74db59ff, "BetCoin Dice"},

+    {0xda5dde84, 0xda5dde94, "Lucky Bit"},
+};
```

In the later discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called the businesses a [“DDoS attack on the bitcoin network“.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c7)

Another user rightly points out that this is nonsense and that the patch is censoring Bitcoin and [changing how users expect it to work.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c8)

>No, it's really not a DoS attack.
>
>There isn't a single reputable journalist or non-fringe blogger who refers to the popularity of the business model of satoshi dice and the other blocked businesses as a "DoS attack"
>
>There is nothing protocol-wise which is invalid about the transactions coming from the sources which are being blacklisted by this patch...

>... this patch is actively censoring and changing the behaviors of bitcoin to no longer act the usual way as defined by the the official non-patched defaults.

He later writes that [SatoshiDice is being punished for being too popular.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c6)

>Just to want to clarify on why the censorship is happening:
>
>The (alleged) attack in question is nothing more than a popular business model which has been attractive and actively used to the point where a non-small amount of traffic was generated by the sites in question. Satoshi Dice, for instance, was widely used enough that it became a target for discrimination.
>
>Paraphrased: "Too popular, and therefore there is a risk of the bitcoin network running out of capacity because of such business plans and their subsequent usage of bitcoin as a method for conducting business operations"

Luke later posted an apology and [removed the patch.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c46)

A year later, he wrote that the [trolls were lying and he never added blacklists to anything.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2zwwpi/i_feel_like_we_need_another_darkwallet_funding/cpnfgr1/)

## 06 October 2014

Gavin Andresen [publishes a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122517/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/) proposing that the 1MB limit be raised to allow for scalability.

He argues that the 1mb fix was always a temporary hack and that Satoshi always intended to raise the block size.

>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.

He also writes that the expectation of Bitcoin holders from the start has always been that Bitcoin would scale up and that meeting those expectations is the same as meeting the expectation that Bitcoin would never increase the coin limit.

>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

## 22 October 2014

[*Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains*](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) is published. The paper

>Because sidechains are still block chains independent of bitcoin, they are free to experiment with new transaction designs, trust models, economic models, asset issuance semantics, or cryptographic features.

The paper is co-authored by Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille.

[Greg Maxwell writes in an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k3u97/we_are_bitcoin_sidechain_paper_authors_adam_back/clhoxvu/) about the paper that he is looking at sidechains as a way to scale Bitcoin without raising the blocksize.

Blockstream [announces](https://blockstream.com/2014/10/23/en-why-we-are-co-founders-of-blockstream/) itself to the world on their blog.

>...we propose technology to enable new cryptocurrency networks that do not need new cryptocurrencies (see our sidechains whitepaper for more information, as well as read an interview with the Wall Street Journal BitBeat). Delivering on this vision will require continued investment in and cooperation with the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, along with the full-time support of many people with broad and specialized backgrounds. 

The co-founders are listed as: Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Mark Friedenbach, Jorge Timón , Austin Hill, Jonathan Wilkins, Francesca Hall, and Alex Fowler.

Greg Maxwell is asked in an AMA about the profit-model of Blockstream and [gives a non-specific answer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k3u97/we_are_bitcoin_sidechain_paper_authors_adam_back/clhoo7d/)

## 07 January 2015

Mircea Popescu [describes a plan to manipulate the market and financially harm anyone supporting Bitcoin XT.](http://btcbase.org/log/?date=07-01-2015#967332) The attack is described further in a [blog post](http://qntra.net/2015/01/the-hard-fork-missile-crisis/) by another Bitcoin Core supporter.

>As the Giga-blockchain and main-blockchain continue to grow from the fork, those actively attacking the Giga-Blockchain will create many transactions that allow their main-blockchain coins to duplicate over to the Giga-blockchain while remaining safely on the main-blockchain. The transactions that succeed can then be used to acquire more main-blockchain coins upon which the cycle repeats. Eventually the blockchain with the most financial resources behind it will continue to grow at a faster pace, while the other slowly, and eventually stops growing altogether.
>
>It will be impossible for the Giga-chain to keep 1:1 parity with the main chain from which it forks, they contain different transaction, although some may overlap. Here a user broadcasts a transaction with inputs originating on the Main-chain, and is eventually included in a block on the Giga-chain, but not on the Main-chain. The coin is essentially duplicated onto both chains.
>
>Those siding with the wrong chain who end up accepting duplicated transactions from the other chain, such as a purchase from an exchange running on the losing blockchain, will lose those coins when the dust settles. No war is without casulties, the Great Blockchain Civil War will be no different.

## 12 January 2015

In response to Gavin Andresen's argument that Bitcoin's block size must be raised so more people can use it, Mircea Popescu writes in an unhinged rant that [Bitcoin is not for poor people.](http://trilema.com/2015/lets-address-some-of-the-more-common-pseudo-arguments-raised-by-the-very-stupid-people-that-like-the-gavin-scamcoin-proposal/)

>Bitcoin isn't for everybody...
>
>Should blocks ever become full, older coinbases will be prioritized over newer coinbases, and larger mining fees and transactions prioritized over smaller mining fees and smaller transactions. This means that someone who wishes to pay for very little with Bitcoin will be forced to use something else, so to speak is forced to "give his seat" to someone richer. This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, unversally, as a matter of course.
>
>You may not like this, but that is entirely an emotional problem of yours, which you're welcome to resolve any way you can: stop being poor, take a lot of pills, whatever...
>
>Run along now, back to playing in the mud with the other naked kids in your village. Bitcoin's just not for your kind.

He also asserts without evidence that Gavin Andresen is a mole for the US Government and threatens to "humiliatingly defeat" him.

## 07 May 2015 

Mike Hearn writes a popular article explaining why [letting the Bitcoin blocks get full would be devesating to adoption of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32) and trust in its future. He predits the rise of an altcoin market as businesses look for new options besides Bitcoin.

>But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.

>I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept, the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative repercussions.

Chinese miners signed a statement that they want [8MB blocks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a0n4m/why_upgrade_to_8mb_but_not_20mb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Signatories included the large mining companies F2pool, BTCChina, Antpool, Huobi, and BW.

Bitcoin.org introduces an official ['position on hard-forks,'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894) which meant it would not promote XT.

The move has support from Theymos, Cobra, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke Dashjr, and others according to the Github thread.

Developer Mike Hearn strongly cririsizes this as a move [towards centraliziation and thought control.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112121007)

>This is very disappointing David. You want to ensure new users don't learn about Bitcoin XT. Why not just say that outright?
>
>Your position is wrong and will just reduce bitcoin.org's utility as a place to learn important information.
>
>What's more, you are inherently supporting a status quo in which a tiny number of people can veto any change to Bitcoin regardless of how widely supported it is by the rest of the community. That's not decentralisation. And it is ultimately far more dangerous to Bitcoin. If you try and shut down the only method the community has to reject the decisions of this tiny group, you're effectively dooming the project to the whims of whoever happened to be around early on in the project and ended up with commit access.

>However, if you really want to "pick a side" in this debate like that, then given the wording of your policy if a >1mb chain wins you will have to replace Bitcoin Core completely and not mention it anywhere, as at that point, it would be the implementation leaving the consensus by attempting to produce a contentious hard fork (the 1mb only chain). So are you sure you thought this through? Are you ready for that pull request, if one day it comes?

Will Binns writes that this move will effectively [sway public opinion towards one side of the debate.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112123722)

>Bitcoin.org should try to say as non-bias as possible in the midst of publicly debated issues. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are coming to this site every day, many of which are new users learning about Bitcoin for the first time. For existing users in the space, this website is also an incredible resource in most cases.

>It seems like this post would be in an effort to sway public opinion more-so than anything else. It doesn't provide a complete context nor link to a wider array of information about the underlying issues it references so the reader can form their own opinion - it comes across as forcing a biased one.

Mike Hearn comments again that the clever wording in this policy—"previous consensus—means that [almost all the major payment processors, exchanges, and wallets would need to be deleted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112124088) in order to be consistent.

>Rereading the policy, there's one more reason this policy is suicide - it says you will delist any wallet or service that announces it will operate on the other side of the "previous consensus".
>
>Currently every single wallet bar GreenAddress that we've polled has told us they support bigger blocks.
>
>Additionally, every major payment processor we've talked to has also said that.
>
>Plus the major exchanges.
>
>So to be consistent with this policy you will have to delete every wallet and all major services (except GreenAddress) from the website. This would eliminate bitcoin.org as a useful place to learn about Bitcoin products and services, which is one of the key functions of the site!

He also correctly points out that raising the block size was always Satoshi's plan.

>I understand you are concerned about the notion of a contentious hard fork. I think you're wrong about the possible consequences though. It should be clear from the block chain when the change has reached a sufficient amount of mining power and at that point there would be plenty of time for services to upgrade before the fork actually happens. Nobody should lose any money and nobody should feel disenfranchised: they can just switch to the winning chain and carry on. They can always sell their coins before or after if they really believe that the plan Satoshi had all along is so bad.

After some back and forth, Mike concludes [the policy is entirely abitrary,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112136250) that most people support raising the blocksize including some Blockstream employees, and that not doing so will harm Bitcoin.

>Ah, so your policy is entirely arbitrary then.
>
>I can as well argue that in fact this situation is not contentious at all - as I said above, all major players agree on the need for larger blocks, indeed, even some Blockstream employees do (or say they do). It's really just a tiny number of people holding up progress at this point. So if you are going to decide that my definition of contentious is wrong and yours is right, just because "it's easy to say", then why have a policy at all? Why not just admit it's your opinion?
>
>Look. I don't mean to be antagonistic. I realise you are attempting to avoid harm to Bitcoin. But remember why Gavin and I are doing this - if the fork does not happen Bitcoin will suffer. You see this as some kind of one-sided deal: if a fork happens it might be bad and hurt Bitcoin, but if it doesn't happen there's no problem!

>I'm the developer of the first and still most widely used SPV wallets. Aaron Voisine is the developer of the most widely used SPV wallet on iOS. Both of us have reached the same conclusion about what will happen if capacity is not raised: it will hurt Bitcoin, a lot. Many others in the community have also reached that conclusion.

>By backing stasis you are not backing stability, or helping preserve Bitcoin's value. You are not taking a principled stand for a better development process. You are instead joining up with those who want to drive the network off a cliff. It is not bitcoin.org's place to make such decisions. Please reconsider this policy.

The issue is merged on Github and the page goes live the following day.
