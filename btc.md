## A timeline history of Bitcoin: lies, propaganda, censorship, and more


## FAQ (maxis read this first)

**bcash is dead. Bitcoin moon. You lose. Why are you writing this?** I'll be the first person to admit in 2020 that the big-block Bitcoin fork experiment may be dead. Drama, network splits, bad decisions, and failure to grow quickly enough have made me less bullish on the success of Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV than ever. But the failure of these experiments does not mean that Bitcoin itself shouldn't have continued along its intended scaling path, it only means that bootstrapping a minority chain may be impossible. Regardless, it is not my intention to prove that Bitcoin should not have changed to become something different than what Satoshi Nakamoto intended. It is only to document the history of how it changed, and to demonstrate that it was not technical or economic arguments that captured Bitcoin, but a social attack of lies, propaganda, threats, censorship, state action, and more.

**Are you a shitcoiner?** No, I believe only one coin can "win" and that the coin that wins will almost certainly be some version Bitcoin with the same database going back to the genesis block. I would not be surprised if BTC is that coin. I would however, be disappointed unless I saw serious improvements over the next few decades. Bitcoin promised to be a lot more than what BTC has thus far delivered. This document, essay, timeline—whatever you want to call it—will show that.

**Who the hell even are you?** Armchair researcher. I have no special qualifications whatsoever other than that I read a lot more than most people and have, not to flatter myself too much, a *very* good memory. But all more sources are cited and you can judge them for yourself.
