## A timeline history of Bitcoin: lies, propaganda, censorship, and more


## FAQ (maxis read this first)

**bcash is dead. Bitcoin moon. You lose. Why are you writing this?** I'll be the first person to admit in 2020 that the big-block Bitcoin fork experiment may be dead. Drama, network splits, bad decisions, and failure to grow quickly enough have made me less bullish on the success of Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV than ever. But the failure of these experiments does not mean that Bitcoin itself shouldn't have continued along its intended scaling path, it only means that bootstrapping a minority chain may be impossible. Regardless, it is not my intention to prove that Bitcoin should not have changed to become something different than what Satoshi Nakamoto intended. It is only to document the history of how it changed, and to demonstrate that it was not technical or economic arguments that captured Bitcoin, but a social attack of lies, propaganda, threats, censorship, state action, and more.

**Are you a shitcoiner?** No, I believe only one coin can "win" and that the coin that wins will almost certainly be some version Bitcoin with the same database going back to the genesis block. I would not be surprised if BTC is that coin. I would however, be disappointed unless I saw serious improvements over the next few decades. Bitcoin promised to be a lot more than what BTC has thus far delivered. This document, essay, timeline—whatever you want to call it—will show that.

**Who the hell even are you?** Armchair researcher. I have no special qualifications whatsoever other than that I read a lot more than most people and have, not to flatter myself too much, a *very* good memory. But all more sources are cited and you can judge them for yourself. 

## Methods and Disclaimers

**Not for goldfish.** This is not a short narrative or listicle. It's a *very* long data-dump covering over a decade of history. It is organised chronologically and can be read straight through or by jumping around to dates that interest you. There is a *lot* of material here which has never before appeared together, and if I suspect the main criticism of this paper will be that I was rather not selective enough. If you want shorter essays, I can recommend John Blocke's fantastic essay on the [censorship of r/bitcoin](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and Daniel Morgan's excellent [scaling debate timeline](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada). If you're new to the history of Bitcoin, those are also good places to start before wade through this.

**No narrative claims.** I'm deliberately leaving out editorializing about grand conspiracies to co-opt Bitcoin. I have my own thoughts on that but in my own experience, starting with those claims tends to make people ignore the well-documented facts that show, whether the effort was intentional, coordinated, or not, it was corrupt, coercive, and effective. Instead I invite readers to form their own conclusions from the timeline of evidence and I hope people may see patterns that I did not. All of that said, I won't leave out information just because it lends itself to a particular theory. If I believe it is true, I have included it.
