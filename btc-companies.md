## WordPress ([November 2012](https://wordpress.com/blog/2012/11/15/pay-another-way-bitcoin/) - [February 2015](https://www.coindesk.com/wordpress-removes-bitcoin-payment-option))

>The volume has been dropping since launch, in 2014 it was only used about twice a week, which is vanishingly small compared to other methods of payment we offer. We supported Bitcoin for philosophical reasons, not commercial ones.
>
>...I think transaction costs should follow Moore’s law, and I don’t think we’re going to get there with the centralized gateways that currently account for the overwhelming majority of transactions.

## Steam ([April 2016](https://cointelegraph.com/news/steam-to-accept-payments-via-bitcoin-in-its-next-update) - [December 2017](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613))

>In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.
>
>Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.
>
>The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).
>
>At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.

## Stripe ([February 2015](https://www.coindesk.com/stripe-bitcoin-payments-option-to-the-public) - [April 2018](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support))

>Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive...
>
>Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange....
>
>This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.
>
>Because of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.

## Fiverr ([February 2014](https://www.coindesk.com/fiverr-coinbase-pay-services-bitcoin) - [January 2017](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1761408.0))

>We noticed that you previously used Bitcoin to purchase services on Fiverr. Effective January 19, 2017, Bitcoin will no longer be accepted as a form of payment on Fiverr. However, you will still be able to make purchases using your debit or credit card, PayPal, or Fiverr credit. Thank you for your understanding, Fiverr Team.

## ProtonMail ([August 2017](https://protonmail.com/blog/bitcoin-secure-email/) - [Present*](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/paying-with-bitcoin/))

ProtonMail is included because although current customers can still pay with Bitcoin, Bitcoin is no longer available at account creation.

>Payment with Bitcoin is currently only available for existing ProtonMail accounts due to the time it takes to confirm a Bitcoin transaction (up to 24 hours). If you currently do not have a ProtonMail account, we recommend creating a free ProtonMail account at protonmail.com/signup. Once you have created your free account, you will be able to upgrade to your desired premium account using Bitcoin...

## PayFast ([July 2014](https://www.payfast.co.za/blog/accept-bitcoin-payments-payfast/) - [July 2019](https://www.payfast.co.za/blog/ending-support-for-bitcoin/))

>As Bitcoin has grown in popularity, it has become increasingly difficult for the network to sufficiently confirm transactions within the 10 minute time limit. Since the network isn’t able to handle the volume of instructions at the speed required, the majority of Bitcoin transactions on the PayFast platform ended up being unsuccessful.
>
>In addition to the frustration that buyers experience when their payments fail, Bitcoin users may also incur a non-refundable fee for every attempted payment. This is the fee the network charges to process a transaction. Therefore anyone trying to pay using Bitcoin opens themselves up to the risk of paying the Bitcoin processing fee, even if the payment fails. The processing fees themselves may vary according to the Bitcoin price and the time required for acceptance to the blockchain. The more Bitcoin gains in value, the higher these fees.
>
>The overall slow performance and computational power consumed by the Bitcoin blockchain to validate transactions, make Bitcoin less useful currently as a means of exchange and better-suited as an asset. It’s estimated that the Bitcoin network can only handle about 7 transactions per second. In comparison Visa performs at around 24,000 transactions per second and even newer cryptocurrencies fare significantly better than Bitcoin with Ripple processing approximately 1,500 transactions per second.

## Reddit ([March 2015](https://www.coindesk.com/reddit-adds-bitcoin-payments-to-merchandise-store) - [May 2018](https://www.coindesk.com/reddit-drops-bitcoin-payment-option-for-gold-membership))

>The upcoming Coinbase change, combined with some bugs around the Bitcoin payment option that were affecting purchases for certain users, led us to remove Bitcoin as a payment option.
