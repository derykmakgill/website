title: Research Bounties On Documents
updated: 2020-11-29
---

I like to think I'm good at tracking things down that nobody else can find, yet things often elude me still. This page lists documents I've failed to find after a few days of searching. Strikethroughs mean I've found the document myself or the bounty has been filled.

If you have a document or know where to find one and want to claim a bounty, [email me.](/contact) I'm also happy to give you credit any time I use the document in research or publishing and a backlink to your website. Lastly, sometimes there are documents I want but I don't really know I want. If by looking at the bounties on this page you think you have something I'll want but isn't listed, please do reach out. Sometimes I might take a while to update this page after finding a document.

Please understand that interest in a document does not mean endorsement of that document, thanks. It is often the case, especially with fiction, that I don't actually know what is in the document beyond some very vague clues until I track it down and read it.
