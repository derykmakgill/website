The HTML code for the footnotes consists of a tiny bit of code that wraps the footnote content. <span class="fnHide"> (Footnote: </span> It is identical for all footnotes which means that it can be saved as a code snippet for repeated use: <span class="footnote">Note that generally you will not want a space between the character immediately before the footnote reference <span class="fnHide">)</span></span>



Note that generally you will not want a space between the character immediately before the footnote reference - for this, there should be no space between the footnote reference number and the <span class=“footnote”> that is the start of the footnote span. Note that since the footnote content is within a span element, in theory only inline elements should be used within the footnote content (in HTML5 such elements are now referred to as phrasing content elements).[Footnote12]
  
  


<div id = "Footnotes"><p class="invis">Footnotes:</p></div>
