title: Cancellation Insurance

It had begun as an obscure 4chan post three years ago which John had forgotten about until today.

CANCELLATYON INSURINCE: I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky
w/e
sue me
(but only if it's payable in BTC)

John wasn't a 4chan user and had only heard about it when, about a year later, it became a viral internet meme when BuzzFeed covered it in a profile about toxic mascunility and its response to "cancel culture." At first he'd ignored it like he ignored most of the culture wars coverage on both sides. John was decidedly culturally and politically agnostic. His motto was "leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone." And with a motto like that, the last thing *he* would ever need to be worried about was getting *canceled.* 

Had he seen some unfair witch hunts? Certainly. But he'd also seen a lot of people he thought had deserved what they got. John had figured if he just went about his work, treated everyone with respect by default, and did no harm, he would be okay. Then a friend of his in graduate school had lost a grant and his employment chances because of a *very* mildly inappropriate joke he'd while drunk at a bar. It was the kind of joke that until yesterday, even the most liberal Hollywood celebrities would have made in a movie and everyone from your raging communist barista to your stodgy conservative great uncle would have laughed about.
