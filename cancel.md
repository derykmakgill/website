title: Cancellation Insurance
---

It had begun as an obscure 4chan post three years ago which John had forgotten about until today.

John wasn't a 4chan user and had only heard about it when, about a year later, it became a viral internet meme when BuzzFeed covered it in a profile about toxic mascunility and its response to "cancel culture." At first he'd ignored it like he ignored most of the culture wars coverage on both sides. John was decidedly culturally and politically agnostic. His motto was "leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone." And with a motto like that, the last thing *he* would ever need to be worried about was getting *canceled.* 

Had he seen some unfair witch hunts? Certainly. But he'd also seen a lot of people he thought had deserved what they got. John had figured if he just went about his work, treated everyone with respect by default, and did no harm, he would be okay. Then a liberal friend of his in graduate school had lost a grant and his employment chances because of a *very* mildly inappropriate joke he'd while drunk at a bar. It was the kind of joke that until yesterday, even the most left-wing Hollywood celebrities would have made in a movie and everyone from your raging communist barista to your stodgy conservative great uncle would have laughed about.

So John had bought some cancellation insurance from one of the hundreds of fly-by-night providers that had sprung up overnight and which only accepted payment in cryptocurrency. He immediately regretted it. Reddit posts from angry young men and exposes in all the major news outlets revealed that all of the cancellation insurance "companies" were scams. Some were typical internet scam, others were left-wing honey pots and the few that tried to be legit turned out to have no idea what they were doing. Almost nobody reported ever getting a payout and the only positive reviews were unverifiable. The meme died almost as quickly as it had exploded.
