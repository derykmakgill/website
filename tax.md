"Hanawalt," George said for the third time. "H-A-N-A-W-A-L-T."

"I'm sorry Mr. Hanawalt," said the IRS agent at the other end of the line, "but we don't have any
records that you owe us anything. Did you say you got a letter in the mail from us?"

"I have the letter in front of me now," George said, unable to hide his frustration. "Look,
you guys have been in pain in my ass for a long time. I've paid you a fortune already in the past ten years,
and the last thing I want is to get slapped with a bunch of fees because
*you* weren't able to find the record in the system."

"I don't know what to tell you Mr. Hanawalt," said the agent. "You don't owe us anything."

"Make a note. That's all. I want it noted in my account so that when one of your goons comes knocking
demanding protection money plus interest I can say that I've been trying to pay. You're the fifth agent I've
talked to about this."

"I will do that Mr. Hanawalt. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

George stopped himself from saying something violent and hung up the phone.
There were a great many things that agent, and everyone who worked with him, could do
to help him. There were a great many more things they could do to entertain him.
But George had more important things to do than daydream the death of bureacrats. 

There was product that needed to be shipped all
over the country and his shipping department was already understaffed this week because several employees
had been let go for stealing.

*Everywhere I turn, someone is robbing me,* thought George to himself.

He poured himself some water from the pitcher and sat down at his computer to send out some emails
he'd needed to send yesterday. He was just about to dash off a quick note to his supplier
in Vietnam that he needed to double his order the following month when he saw it.

A chat notification. Normally George muted those. He hated any kind of instant messenger and couldn't understand
how anybody could get any work done with the constant distraction. He only had one installed so he could communicate with a couple clients overseas, and he was
just moving his mouse to click out when he noticed the chat appeared to be from an application he
had never used. 

*That's odd,* he thought. The preview simply said: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;"> Tax Refund</code>. *Someone was screwing with him.*

He clicked open the chat. It wasn't like any chat application he had used in a long time. It was just a black box. And in the top left corner were the same words: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;"> Tax Refund</code>. 

George was familiar with phishing scams. He'd made his money on the internet after all. He knew he should close the application and clean his system for whatever malware caused the application to be downloaded. And that is exactly
what he was about to do when another chat appeared in the box: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Hello George. I've been looking forward to chatting with you for a long time.</code>

He frowned at the message window, then typed: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Who are you?</code>

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">I am the Director of the ERS</code>, he replied.

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">That doesn't exist. Goodbye.</code> George was already bored of this conversation.

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Sorry. It's a bad joke. The External Refund Service. I've wanted to use it for a long time. I guess you can call me M,</code> M replied, <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">but please, George, I don't have much time and it is important we discuss your refund.</code>

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">I don't have a refund!</code> George pounded the keyboard.

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">You just spoke to an IRS agent about a letter you received in the mail about additional taxes you would owe this year, but they said you owed nothing, right?</code> 

How did this hacker, phisher, troll, FED, or whoever he was know George had made that call? He looked over at his phone suspiciously. Had it been compromised? Was he being watched now? 

He began to type more nervously now: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">how did you know that?</code>

M replied at once. The guy *could type!* <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">That doesn't matter George. What matter is that I fixed it. You don't owe them any more money this year. The record is gone. But we really need to talk about your refund.</code>

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Okay...I'm listening...but I'm not giving you anymore personal information.</code>

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">598-391-9444.</code> M replied.

George froze. That was his social security number. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">How the fuck did you get that?!</code> he typed. This guy...whoever he was, he was dangerous. He had his social security number and God knew what else. What did he really want?

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm trying to help.</code> M wrote. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">I've been through all your tax records over the last twenty odd years. They've stolen a lot of money from you. I'm giving it back.</code>

*I should report him,* George thought to himself. He knew some guys at the FBI. He could report him to them and... *what?* he thought. *What would they do?* George was beginning to suspect that whoever this M was, he was not going to be easily caught.

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">You had no right to do go through my finances like that</code>, George wrote.

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">They had no right to do that, George.</code> M replied.

*So he's some kind of hacker activist,* thought George. George didn't like activists. But M seemed different. And someone who hated the IRS as much as he did must be all right in his book. He decided to play along for now. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Okay. Assuming that is true, that you have a refund for me, who is paying for it?"
  
<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">lol.</code> M replied. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">You're paying for it. It's a refund.</code>

That really wasn't George's question. He wanted to know where the money, if it even existed, was coming from. Almost like he was reading his mind, M typed again: <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">If you mean, "who is going to wake up tomorrow and realise they are missing a lot of money, well, I'm not too worried about that. I've been doing this a long time. Did you know there are over two million employees of our fine republic? If they each gave you fifty cents, would they even notice? A dollar? Would they notice? Would they even notice five dollars?</code>

There it was. The last thing George wanted was any trouble at all from the government. Sure, he occasionally lost his cool had a few choice words for IRS agents, but this was an entirely new level of defiance. Even if *he* knew it wasn't really stealing, it didn't matter in the eyes of the law. They would throw the *fucking* book at him. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">I don't want anything to do with this. Please stop.</code>

<code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">Too late, George.</code> said M. <code style="font-family: courier new, monospace;">It's already started. And stop acting like a pussy. You aren't one. So stop acting like one.</code>

George's phone beeped. A push notification from his mobile Bitcoin wallet showed a new unconfirmed transaction. Almost automatically, he swiped it and nearly spit out the water he'd been sipping. *1,000,000.*
