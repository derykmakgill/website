title: The Origins of Money by Carl Menger
---

Menger helped me understand through the concept of *saleability* that money itself is merely the most saleable good, ie, its the good that can be most easily traded for anything at any time. I don't think many people understand the implications of this so I will make it clear: if we define money as a saleable good, it means that when we are buying a good with money, we are in fact selling money for that good. To put in another way, in any trade, one party is buying a good or service, another party is buying money. Fascinating! We are both buyers and sellers at any time.
