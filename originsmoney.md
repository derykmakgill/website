title: The Origins of Money by Carl Menger
---

Menger helped me understand through the concept of *saleability* that money itself is merely the most saleable good, ie, its the good that can be most easily traded for anything at any time. I don't think many people understand the implications of this so I will make it clear: if we define money as a saleable good, it means that when we are buying a good with money, we are in fact selling money for that good. To put in another way, in any trade, one party is buying a good or service, another party is buying money. Or one party is selling money and anothe party is selling a good. Fascinating! We are both buyers and sellers at any time.

This is no mere semantic parlor tick. From this understanding, we can begin to understand so much more. For example, just as price fixing and subsidies for particular commodities can lead to problems, so too can we say the same thing about money because money is merely the most saleable of all commodities, and at any time money itself can command its price. It helps us understand that money is emphatically *not* a measure of value.

>Money is neither a yardstick of value nor of prices. Money does not measure value. Nor are prices measured in money: they are amounts of money. And, although those who describe money as a "standard of deferred payments" naively assume it to be so, as a commodity it is not stable in value. The relation between money and goods perpetually fluctuates not only on the "goods side," but on the "money side" also. As a rule, indeed, these fluctuations are not too violent. They do not too much impair the economic calculus, because under a state of continuous change of all economic conditions, this calculus takes in view only comparatively short periods, in which ‘sound money’ at least does not change its purchasing power to any very great extent.
